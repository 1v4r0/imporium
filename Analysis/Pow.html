  <div class="back"> <a href="Analysis.html">Back</a> </div>
  This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
  school system, some objects will be simplified some details will be omitted.
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Power Functions </h1></center>
    Power functions are similar to <a href="Exponential.html">exponential
    functions</a> in structure, but
    rather different in nature. The only difference in structure is that you
    "flip" the power, so that the variable becomes the base and the constant
    becomes the exponent, as such
      $$f(x)=bx^a$$
    </div>
    The most immediate difference in nature is the interpretation of the
    constants, for rational \(a=\frac{n}{m}\) we have the interpretation that
    \(x^{a}=\sqrt[m]{x^n}\) which has some domain issues if \(m\) is even and
    \(x^n< 0\) since taking even roots of negative numbers yields complex
    numbers as results. If we extend it to \(a\in\mathbb{R}\) it only becomes
    more complicated, which together with the result that for any \(n< 0\),
    \(f(0)=\infty\) will motivate us to restrict ourselves to \(x>0\) on
    first approach, i.e. \(dom(f)=\mathbb{R}_+^*=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:x>0\).<br>
    For an interpretation of \(b\) consider that
      $$f(1)=b⋅1^a=b⋅1=b$$
    so it's not the initial value as such, but the value at 1, which feels much
    less satisfactory than initial value for the exponential function, but such
    is life.
    <div class="pro"><center><h2>Proposition(Nature of Growth) </h2></center>
      As with other function types, the nature of the growth of power functions
      is that if we increase the x-value by a specific percentage, then the
      y-value will increase by another percentage dependent on \(a\), more
      specifically do we have the following relation
        $$r_y=(1+r_x)^a-1$$
      </div>
      To observe this consider that
        $$f(x(1+r_x))=b(x(1+r_x))^a=bx^a(1+r_x)^a=f(x)(1+r_y)$$
      This may come as no surprise, but power functions also have its own
      two-point theorem.
    <div class="thm"><center><h2> Two-Point Theorem </h2></center>
      Given two points \((x_1,y_1)\) and \((x_2,y_2\), there is a unique power
      function who's graph passes through those two points and it has the
      following constants
        $$a=\frac{\log(y_2)-\log(y_1)}{\log(x_2)-\log(x_1)}$$
      and
        $$b=\frac{y_i}{x_i^a}$$
      </div>
        <h3> Proof </h3>
          The proof starts out pretty identical to the others, by removing \(b\)
          \begin{align}
            &&\frac{y_2}{y_1}=&\frac{\cancel{b}x_2^a}{\cancel{b}x_1^a}=\left(
            \frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)^a\\
            \implies&&\log\left(\frac{y_2}{y_1}\right)=&\log\left(\left(
            \frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)^a\right)=a\log\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)\\
            \implies&&a=&\frac{\log(y_2/y_1)}{\log(x_2/x_1)}=\frac{\log(y_2)-
            \log(y_1)}{\log(x_2)-\log(x_1)}
          \end{align}
          and reintroducing \(b\) we just find it by isolating it in the
          function expression.<p style="text-align:center;">&#x220E;</p>
      <div class="thm"><center><h2> Integer Power Derivative Theorem </h2>
      </center>
        Assume than we have a power function with non-zero integer exponent, i.e.
        \(f(x)=x^n\), then its derivative is \(f'(x)=nx^{n-1}\). I've chosen
        \(b=1\) since all it does is scale the derivative and can be added
        afterwards.
      </div>
        <h2> Proof </h2>
          We will per form a proof by induction, which entails confirming a
          base case and the induction step. So lets take as our base case
          \(n=1\), which yields \(f(x)=x\implies f'(x)=1=nx^{n-1}\) which
          comforms to our statement. Now assume some integer
          \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) also conforms to the statement and investigate
          its successor \(n=k+1\). We start by writing the "rise" of the secant line
          and then transitioning into the slope and then rewriting it into something
          that depends on the secant slope for \(n=k\) and using our induction assumption.
          \begin{align}
            &&(x+h)^{k+1}-x^{k+1}=&(x+h)^k(x+h)-x^kx\\
            &&=&(x+h)^kx+(x+h)^kh-x^kx\\
            &&=&x((x+h)^k-x^k)+(x+h)^kh\\
            \implies&&a=&x\frac{(x+h)^k-x^k}{h}+\frac{(x+h)^k\cancel{h}}{\cancel{h}}\\
            &&\to&xkx^{k-1}+x^k\\
            &&=&(k+1)x^k
          \end{align}
          if \(n< 0\) then we can perform a similar argument with \(n=-k\)
          \begin{align}
            &&(x+h)^{-k-1}-x^{-k-1}=&(x+h)^{-k}(x+h)^{-1}-x^{-k}x^{-1}\\
            &&=&(x+h)^{-k}(x+h)^{-1}-x^{-k}(x+h)^{-1}+x^{-k}(x+h)^{-1}-x^{-k}x^{-1}\\
            &&=&(x+h)^{-1}((x+h)^{-k}-x^{-k})+x^{-k}\left(\frac{1}{x+h}-\frac{1}{x}\right)\\
            &&=&(x+h)^{-1}((x+h)^{-k}-x^{-k})+x^{-k}\left(\frac{\cancel{x}-(\cancel{x}+h)}{x(x+h)}\right)\\
            \implies&&a=&(x+h)^{-1}\frac{((x+h)^{-k}-x^{-k}}{h}+x^{-k}\left(\frac{-\cancel{h}}{\cancel{h}x(x+h)}\right)\\
            &&\to&x^{-1}(-kx^{k-1})-x^{-k}x^{-2}\\
            &&=&(-k-1)x^{k-2}
          \end{align}

        <h1> Real Powers </h1>
          Now assume the power is \(a\in\mathbb{R}\), then we can write the function
          as \(f(x)=x^a=e^{\ln(x^a)}=e^{a\ln(x)}\), which immediately yields the
          following result by the formula for the derivative of a composite function
            $$f'(x)=e^{a\ln(x)}a\ln'(x)=ax^a\frac{1}{x}=ax^{a-1}$$
