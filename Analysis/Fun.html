  This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
  school system, some objects will be simplified and some details will be omitted.
  <h1> Definition of a Function</h1>
    A function is a mathematical object that relates pairs of other objects.
    This can be done in multiple ways but the most immediately obvious way, that
    even young children could do, is to simply place those two objects near
    each other. You can also connect those two objects by a string or by some
    description. Since we will mostly be working with mathematical abstractions,
    most of our relations will be described mathematically. As an example,
    consider the following sets of objects
      $$X=(car_1, car_2)$$
    and
      $$Y=(car_3,car_4)$$
    and
      $$Z=(red,green,blue)$$
    We could make a function that related the car to its colour, examples of
    such functions could be the following
      $$f:X\mapsto Z\text{, and }g:X\cup Y\mapsto Z$$
    where we call \(X=dom(f)\) and \(f(X)=ran(f)\) the
    "domain" and "range" of \(f\) respectively, and \(Z\) is the "co-domain" of both.
    Let these functions be defined as follows
      $$f(car_1)=green, f(car_2)=blue$$
    and
      $$g(car_1)=red,g(car_2)=green,g(car_3)=blue,g(car_4)=red$$
    where the first function represents the car's interior and the second
    represents the exterior paint. The first function is called
    "injective", since each car, in the domain, is assigned a
    seperate colour in the range. This is not true for the second function,
    since two cars are red, but it has another property, namely that for each
    colour in the co-domain, there is a car with that colour. This property is
    called being "surjective", which the first function is not since
    neither of the cars are red. If a function is both injective and surjective
    it is really nice, since each object in the domain and range is assigned
    a unique object in the other, and is called "bijective".
    <div class="def">These can be skipped on first approach <center><h2>
      Rigorous Definitions of<br>Injectivity, Surjectivity and Bijectivity </h2></center>
      For a function \(g:X\mapsto Z\) and \(Y\subset X\) we define
        $$g(Y)=\{z\in Z:z=f(y)\text{ for }y\in Y\}$$
      In relation to our example, its all the colours that are used as
      exterior colours for the last two cars.
      A function \(f:X\mapsto Z\) is injective if
        $$f(x_i)=f(x_j)\implies x_i=x_j$$
      It's surjective if
        $$f(X)=Z$$
      and it's bijective if it's both.</div>
      This property has some consequences for the so-called inverse function.
    <div class="def"><center><h2> Inverse Functions</h2></center>
      Relating pairs of objects is theoretically a symmetric process but it
      is very useful, and common practice, to consider functions as directed
      relations, going from one object to the other. The opposite direction
      is then called the "inverse" function. The function \(f:X\mapsto Y\)
      will then have the inverse function \(f^{-1}:Y\mapsto X\) with the
      property that
        $$f^{-1}(y)=\{x\in X:f(x)=y\}$$</div>
      This can lead to the uncomfortable situation where the inverse function
      can have multiple values for each object in its domain. To be honest,
      this is not unique to the inverse function, if you consider our
      example from previously, we could imagine a car having two colours, i.e.
        $$g(car_1)=\{red,blue\}$$
      which could represent it being purple, or simply that it's not
      monochromatic. These types of functions are called "multi-valued"
      functions and you may encounter them again in the future, but for the
      current treatment I will not be analysing multi-valued
      functions in depth. Instead I will mostly consider single-valued inverse
      functions, and this can be accomplished by making sure that the original
      function is injective.
      <div class="thm"><center><h3> Inverse functions</h3></center>
        An injective function \(f:X\mapsto Y\) will have a single-valued
        inverse function, and the property that
          $$x=f^{-1}(f(x))$$
        for all \(x\in X\). If it's bijective we also have that
          $$y=f(f^{-1}(y))$$
        for all \(y\in Y\).</div>
        <h4> Proof</h4>
          Let \(y\in ran(f)\), and assume that we have two values, \(x_1\) and
          \(x_2\) that get mapped to it. Then we have
          \begin{align}
            &&f^{-1}(y)=&\{x\in X:f(x)=y\}\\
            &&\supset&\{x_1,x_2\}\\
            \implies&&f(x_1)=&f(x_2)=y\\
            \implies&&x_1=&x_2
          \end{align}
          by injectivity, which shows the inverse is single valued. Lets drop
          the subscript since they are equal, then we get
            $$f^{-1}(y)=f^{-1}(f(x))=x$$
          For the second identity, we just use surjectivety, i.e. that
          \(ran(f)=Y\), to allow us to choose any \(y\in Y\) to perform the
          following argument
            $$y=f(x)=f(f^{-1}(y))$$<p style="text-align:center;">&#x220E;</p>
        Examples of bijective functions are non-constant linear functions
        \(f(x)=ax+b\) with \(X=Y=\mathbb{R}\) and inverse
          $$x=f^{-1}(y)=\frac{y-b}{a}$$
        <a href="Exp.html">Exponential
        functions</a> \(f(x)=ba^x\) with \(X=\mathbb{R}\),
        \(Y=\mathbb{R}_+\), and
          $$x=f^{-1}(y)=\frac{\log(y)-\log(b)}{\log(a)}$$
        specifically, if \(b=1\) and \(a=e\) then we get that \(\log(y)\) is
        the inverse function to the natural exponential function. We also
        have <a href="Pow.html">power functions</a> \(f(x)=bx^a\) with
        \(X=Y=\mathbb{R}_+\) and
          $$x=f^{-1}(y)=\sqrt[a]{\frac{y}{b}}$$
        which is why we choose both \(y,b>0\) so we don't get complex
        numbers for now.

    <h2> Real Domains </h2>
      So far I have allowed functions to act on arbitrary(non-mathematical)
      objects, which will be useful for <a href="../ProThe/ProThe.html">
      probability theory</a> since you can consider random processes with all
      sorts of weird objects, and have the probability function relate them to
      a number, namely it's probability. But in most other settings, including
      <a href="../ProThe/RanVar.html">random variables</a>, it will
      be more useful to consider domains that are real numbers, since it will
      allow for us to perform calculations on them, you can't add cars, but you
      can add numbers. When the domain and range have similar numbers, we don't
      really make the distinction of which is which, so that \(x\) is
      always considered to be in the domain and \(y\) in the range. With this
      convention, we will write
        $$x=f(f^{-1}(x))=f^{-1}(f(x))$$
      <h3> Vector Functions </h3>
        Sometimes we are interested in relating pairs, and even sets, of numbers
        to another. An example is the ideal gas law from physics
          $$PV=nRT$$
        where we can calculate the pressure if we know the other variables by
        the following function
          $$P(V,n,T)=R\frac{nT}{V}$$
        To avoid having to deal with infinities we can restrict the variables to
        be strictly positive
          $$dom(P)=\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}_+=\mathbb{R}_+^3$$
        This is pretty much the same thing as three dimensional vectors with
        positive coordinates. In general, the most common domains are the
        so-called Euclidean Spaces,
          $$X=\mathbb{R}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}^n$$
        where \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) is called the dimension. It might not be clear
        how any vectors higher than 3 or 4 might be useful, but in AI research
        you often deal with functions with domains that have dimensions in the
        dozens, hundreds or higher. In the case of the ideal gas law function,
        the domain consisted of three dimensional vectors while the range was
        just a single number, i.e.
          $$P:\mathbb{R}_+^3\to\mathbb{R}_+$$
        In general a vector function will defined as
          $$f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$$
        where \(n,m\in\mathbb{N}\).
