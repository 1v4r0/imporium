  school system, some objects will be simplified some details will be omitted.
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Integrals </h1></center>
    The so called definite integral of a function f on an interval \([a,b]\) is
    defined as the area under the graph of f in that interval. There are several
    ways to define this and one is to divide the interval into sub-intervals
    \(a=x_0< x_1< x_2 < \cdots< x_N=b\) and then add up the areas of the
    rectangles that have the function value \(f(t_n)\) as its height and the
    width \(\Delta x_n=x_n-x_{n-1}\). If we then make the sub-intervals narrower
    and narrower, we will approach the true area under the graph. This yields
    the following definition for the definite integral
      $$\int_a^b f(x)dx=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(t_n)\Delta x_n$$</div>
    <div class="thm"><center><h2>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h2></center>
      The theorem has two seperate parts, the first part states that for a
      suitably nice function \(f(x)\), the following function
        $$F(x)=\int_a^xf(x)dx$$
      is an antiderivate to \(f(x)\), i.e. that \(F'(x)=f(x)\).<br>
      The second part states that for any antiderivate \(F(x)\) of \(f(x)\) we
      have that
        $$\int_a^bf(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)$$</div>
      We will need two versions of the so-called mean value theorem for our proof.
      <div class="pro"><center><h3> The Mean Value Propositions </h3></center>
        The
        first states that if \(f(x)\) is differentiable in the interval
        \(]a,b[\) then there exists a \(c\in]a,b[\) such that
          $$f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$
        which in essence means that there is a value in the domain where
        the slope is the same as the average slope on the entire interval.<br>
        The second theorem states that if \(f(x)\) is continuous on \([a,b]\),
        then we can find a \(c\in[a,b]\) such that
          $$f(c)=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)dx$$
        which means that the area under the graph is equal to the area of a
        rectangle with the interval length as its width and height corresponding
        to the function value at some point in the interval.</div>
        Being propositions, I will not prove these, but go straight to the
        proof of the fundamental theorem.
      <h3> Proof </h3>
        For the first part we want to differentiate \(F(x)\) so lets consider
        \begin{align}
          &&F(x+h)-F(x)=&\int_a^{x+h}f(x)dx-\int_a^xf(x)dx\\
          &&=&\int_x^{x+h}f(x)dx\\
          &&=&(x+h-x)\frac{1}{x+h-x}\int_x^{x+h}f(x)dx\\
          &&=&hf(t)\\
          \implies&&\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}\to&f(x)
        \end{align}
        since \(t\in[x,x+h]\).<br>
        Now consider the following
        \begin{align}
          F(b)-F(a)=&F(x_N)-F(x_{N-1})+F(x_{N-1})-F(x_{n-2})+\\
          \cdots&+F(x_2)-F(x_{1})+F(x_1)-F(x_0)\\
          =&\sum_{n=1}^N F(x_n)-F(x_{n-1})\\
          =&\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{F(x_n)-F(x_{n-1})}{x_n-x_{n-1}}(x_n-x_{n-1})\\
          =&\sum_{n=1}^N F'(t_n)\Delta x_n\\
          \to&\int_a^bf(x)dx
        \end{align}
      Since the left-hand-side is a constant, the limit must be that same constant.
