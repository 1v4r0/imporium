  <h1> Interests</h1>
    To calculate the interests on a capital, \(C_0\), with an interest-rate, r,
    we multiply them, \(I=C_0⋅r\). To then calculate the new capital we add the
    interests to the initial capital,
      $$C_1=C_0+I=C_0+C_0⋅r=C_0(1+r)$$
    For the next term, we consider this the initial capital and to calculate the
    next capital the same formula yields
      $$C_2=C_1(1+r)=C_0(1+r)(1+r)=C_0(1+r)^2$$
    and I hope it's not much of a stretch to imagine that the general formula
    will become
      $$C_n=C_0(1+r)^n$$
    and this is called the compound interest formula, because the interests
    accumulate additional interests.
  <h1> Euler's Number </h1>
    Usually interest-rates on loans and savings are given as a per annum, or
    yearly, interest-rates but sometimes loans are calculated monthly or even
    daily. This raises an immediate question, how do I calculate from one
    term-length to another? Well, we have to consider the compound interest
    formula, because if we have a p.a. interest-rate of \(r_y\) and a monthly
    interest-rate of \(r_m\) the yearly interest should be identical, i.e.
      $$C_0(1+r_y)=C_0(1+r_m)^{12}\implies r_m=\sqrt[12]{1+r_y}-1$$
    so in general, going from one term-length to another with interest-rates
    \(r_1,r_2\) respectively, we just have to solve the equation
      $$(1+r_1)=(1+r_2)^n$$
    where \(n\) is how many of the shorter term the longer term contains.<br>\
    One thing that you might naively suggest is just to take the longer term
    interest-rate and divide by \(n\), i.e. \(r_2=\frac{r_1}{n}\). If you do
    this with \(r_1=1=100\%\), i.e. the capital should be doubled at the end of
    the term, the compound interest formula will yield following expression
      $$C_n=C_0(1+\frac{1}{n})^n$$
    For \(n=1\) it does indeed double the initial capital, but at \(n=2\) we get
    \(C_n=2.25C_0\) so we gain an extra 25%. If we decrease the term-length
    further from bi-yearly, to quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and
    so forth, this number will keep increasing but flattens out eventually. The
    upper limit of this sequence is
      $$e=2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995\ldots$$
    and is called Euler's number. This naive approach to interests has actually
    provided us with one of the most fundamental numbers in all of math, but
    specifically exponential functions.
    <h1> Exponential Functions </h1>
      An exponential function is an object that is reminiscent of compound
      interests, but in the spirit of generilization we will use more general
      notation
        $$f(x)=ba^x$$
      where \(b\) represents the initial capital, but is called the
      intial-value, while I will call \(a=1+r\) the growth-factor with \(r\)
      representing the interest-rate, but called the growth-rate in this new
      context. On first approach, we will only consider positive initial-value,
      i.e. \(b>0\) but we will allow a broader range of growth-factors. The
      benefit of this approach is that we can allow a broad range of
      "term-values", fx. we can do \(f(0)=ba^0=b⋅1=b\) which explains why it's
      called the initial value. We can go "back in time" by considering
      \(x< 0\) and we can allow arbitrarily small "term-lengths".
      <h2> Growth-Factor </h2>
        There are some natural restrictions on the growth-factor, namely that
        the growth-rate cannot be lower than -100%, you can't lose more than
        all of your initial-value. In fact, we will not allow \(r=-1=-100\%\)
        which means that \(a=1+r>0\). However there is no upper bound on the
        growth-factor. There are two important distinct regions of values that
        correspond to important distinct cases, namely positive and negative
        growth-rates, the case where the growth-rate is zero is not interesting
        and will also be discounted. These regions are \(0< a< 1\) and \(a>1\),
        corresponding to negative and positive growth-rates respectively, and
        therefore these two classes are the decreasing and increasing functions
        respectively.<br>
        One very common way to represent the growth-factor is with the
        previously mentioned Euler's number in the following way
        \(a=e^k\), which yields the following function \(f(x)=be^{kx}\). Physics
        has several exponential models where the constant \(k\) has a specific
        name, when modelling radioactive decay, it's called the decay-constant,
        when modelling the absorption of radiation it's called the
        absorption coefficient. The case where \(k=1\), i.e. \(a=e\) is called
        the natural exponential function and is one of the most important
        functions in math.
      <h2> Logarithms </h2>
        To continue our investigation of exponential functions, we will need to
        consider their inverse functions, which are called logarithms. I will
        use the following notation
          $$\log_a(a^x)=a^{\log_a(x)}=x$$
        where \(a\) is called the base. When \(a=e\) we call it the natural
        logarithm and omit it from the notation, i.e. \(\log_e=\log\)
        and call it the natural logarithm. It should be noted that engineers and
        some computer technicians might consider \(\log=\log_10\), and use the
        notation \(\log_e=\ln\) for the natural logarithm. For mathematicians
        the function \(10^x\) is generally much less interesting than the
        natural exponential function which is why we often do not follow this
        tradition.<br>
        Logarithms have inverse-properties compared to exponentials, i.e. when
        exponentials move in the calculation-hierarchy, logarithms do the
        oppasite, in particular, we have these important properties.
        <h3> Theorem </h3>
          1. \(\log(a⋅b)=\log(a)+\log(b)\)<br>
          2. \(\log(a^x)=x\log(a)\)
          <h4> Proof </h4>
            Consider \(a=e^{\log(a)}\) and \(b=e^{\log(b)}\), then
            \begin{align}
              &&a⋅b=&e^{\log(a)}e^{\log(b)}\\
              &&=&e^{\log(a)+\log(b)}\\
              \implies&&\log(a⋅b)=&\cancel{\log}\left(
              \cancel{e}^{\log(a)+\log(b)}\right)\\
              &&=&\log(a)+\log(b)
            \end{align}
            which was the first statement, we can do something similar with the
            second statement
            \begin{align}
              \log(a^x)=&\log\left(\left(e^{\log(a)}\right)^x\right)\\
              =&\log\left(e^{x\log(a)}\right)\\
              =&x\log(a)
            \end{align}
          It should be noted that we used the natural logarithm, but the same
          applies to any base which you can confirm by modifying the proof.<br>
          So where exponentials turn sums into products and products into
          exponents, logarithms turn products into sums, and exponents into
          products. Quotients and roots are just special cases of products and
          exponents so they are also covered.
      <h2> Doubling Constant </h2>
        One very interesting property of exponential functions is that they
        have a so-called doubling constant, which is defined as how much the
        x-value needs to be changed to double the function-value, and can be
        calculated as follows
          $$T_2=\frac{\log(2)}{\log(a)}=\frac{\log(2)}{k}$$
        <h3> Lemma(Exponential Growth) </h3>
          To prove this statement, I will first state and prove a lemma on
          the effect on the function-value by adding a constant to the x-value
            $$f(x+h)=f(x)⋅a^h$$
          so adding \(h\) has the effect of multiplying the function value by
          \(a^h\).
          <h4> Proof </h4>
            \begin{align}
              f(x+h)=&ba^{x+h}\\
              =&ba^xa^h\\
              =&f(x)a^h
            \end{align}
          <h3> Corollary(Doubling Constant) </h3>
            In the case of the doubling constant, we want to figure out what to
            add to double the function value, i.e.
            \begin{align}
              &&2=&a^{T_2}\\
              \implies&&\log(2)=&T_2\log(a)\\
              \implies&&T_2=&\frac{\log(2)}{\log(a)}=\frac{\log(2)}{\log(e^k)}=
              \frac{\log(2)}{k}
            \end{align}
            For the first part of the formula, it can be any arbitrary
            logarithm, but for the last part, it actually needs to be the
            natural logarithm, or it's won't cancel the natural exponential
            function.<br>
            Many text-books will only allow doubling-constants for increasing
            exponential functions, and consider a so-called "halving-constant"
            for decreasing ones. But for decreasing ones, you will just get a
            negative value, which corresponds to needing to decrease your
            x-value to double the function-value, so it is an unecessary
            distinction.<br>
            In physics the doubling constants related to radioactive decay and
            absorption of radiation are called half-life(like the video game)
            and halving-width.
        <h2> Two-Point Theorem </h2>
          As is the case with linear functions, given two points, \((x_1,y_1)\)
          and \((x_2,y_2)\) we can determine the exponential function which has
          a graph that passes through those two points, and it has the
          growth-factor and initial-value
            $$a=\sqrt[x_2-x_1]{\frac{y_2}{y_1}}$$
          and
            $$b=\frac{y_i}{a^{x_i}}$$
          <h3> Proof </h3>
            Lets assume that the points lie on the graph, then we have
              $$y_i=ba^{x_i}$$
            by dividing one of these by the other we obtain
            \begin{align}
              &&\frac{y_2}{y_1}=&\frac{\cancel{b}a^{x_2}}{\cancel{b}a^{x_1}}\\
              &&=&a^{x_2-x_1}\\
              \implies&&\sqrt[x_2-x_1]{\frac{y_2}{y_1}}=&
              \sqrt[x_2-x_1]{a^{x_2-x_1}}=a
            \end{align}
            The formula for the initial value is just trivial isolation in the
            function expression.
        <h2> Exponential Regression </h2>
          To perform exponential regression on a dataset \((x_n,y_n)\) we simply
          consider that
            $$\log(y)=\log(ba^x)=x\log(a)+\log(b)$$
          so we can simply do a linear regression on the dataset \((\log(x_n),
          \log(y_n))\) and then to extract the growth factor and initial value
          we simply take the natural exponential function of the slope and
          y-intercept respectively.
