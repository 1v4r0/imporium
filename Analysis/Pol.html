  This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
  school system, some objects will be simplified some details will be omitted.
  <h1> Polynomials </h1>
    A polynomial is probably the class of functions that has the most
    interesting growth pattern so far.
    <div class="def"><center><h2> Laurent Polynomials</h2></center>
    The most generalized version of a
    polynomial in the current setting is the so-called Laurent polynomial. It is
    defined as the sum of power functions with integer exponents, i.e.
      $$p(x)=\sum_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}a_ix^i$$
    where \(a_i\in\mathbb{C}\) are the coefficients.
  </div>
  These are relatively
    complex objects so I will restrict myself to real coefficients, with most of
    them being zero, including all the negative index ones. In fact, what's left
     is the "normal" polynomial
    <div class="def"><center><h2> Polynomials</h2></center>
    When a Laurent polynomial has \(a_i=0\) for \(i< 0\) and \(i>n\) and
    \(a_i\in\mathbb{R}\) for \(0\leq i\leq n\) we omit
    the "Laurent" and just call it a polynomial with the following expression
      $$p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i=a_0+a_1x+\cdots+a_nx^n$$
    where some of these coefficients might still be zero, just not the last one.
    The so-called degree of this polynomial is the highest exponent, \(n\).
  </div>
    There is an important theorem, named the fundamental theorem of algebra,
    that states that the polynomial always has \(n\) roots, with
    so-called "multiplicity". With respect to the roots the polynomial can
    always be written in a factorized form as
      $$p(x)=a_n\prod_{i=0}^n(x-r_i)$$
    where
      $$p(0)=a_0=a_n\prod_{i=1}^nr_i$$
    where \(r_i\) are all the roots, and their multiplicity is how many times
    they appear in this product. If a polynomial has more than one real root
    then its graph must intersect the x-axis at least twice, which means that
    the slope of the graph must change sign at least once. This means that there
    are polynomials that are not strictly monotonous unlike power- and
    exponential functions.
    <h2> Derivatives </h2>
      We can differentiate the polynomial term-wise and get
        $$p'(x)=\sum_{i\in Z}ia_ix^{i-1}$$
      We can also use the product rule on the factorized form
        $$p'(x)=a_n\sum_{i=1}^n\prod_{j\neq i}(x-r_j)$$
      with
        $$p'(0)=a_1=(-1)^{n-1}a_n\sum_{i=1}^n\prod_{j\neq i}r_j$$
    <h2> Binomial Coefficients </h2>
      Consider the polynomial
        $$p(x)=(x+1)^n=\sum_{i=0}^n{n\choose i}x^i$$
      which has the root \(x=-1\) with multiplicity \(n\). The expression
      comes from expanding the parenthesis, since a power \(x^i\) must take an
      \(x\) from \(i\) factors and a 1 from the rest. This in effect means
      that we have to choose \(i\) out of \(n\) factors, which is done in
      \(n\choose i\) ways by combinatorics. If we subtract an \(x\) from the
      left hand parenthesis, we get
        $$(x+1-x)^n=1^n=1=\sum_{i=0}^n{n\choose i}x^i(1-x)^{n-p}$$
      which verifies that the <a href="../ProThe/BinDis.html">binomial
      distribution</a> is in fact a probability distribution, since this
      expression calculates the probability of all the random values for \(x=p\).
      If we consider
        $$(1-1)^n=0^n=0=\sum_{i=0}^n{n\choose i}1^i(-1)^{n-i}=\sum_{i=0}^n
        {n\choose i}(-1)^{n-i}$$
      we can observe that if we alternately add and subtract a line in Pascal's
      triangle, the result adds up to 0.
    <div class="def"><center><h2> Quadratics </h2></center>
      The one class of polynomials we will spend most of our time investigating
      are the ones of degree 2, which are known as quadratics, with the
      convention of writing \(a_2=a\), \(a_1=b\) and \(a_0=c\), i.e.
        $$p(x)=ax^2+bx+c$$
      </div>
      These three coefficients have interesting graphical interpretations but
      only the one for \(c\) is immediately obvious.
        $$f(0)=a⋅0^2+b⋅0+c=c$$
      so it's simply the initial value or the y-intercept. For \(b\) consider
      the derivative of both the normal and factorized form
        $$\boxed{p'(x)=2ax+b}=a(x-r_2+x-r_1)=\boxed{2ax-(r_1+r_2)}$$
      which means that
        $$p'(0)=2a⋅0+b=b$$
      So the interpretation of \(b\) is that it is the slope of the graph at the
      y-axis and related the sum of the roots, \(b=-a(r_1+r_2)\). The last part
      of that is the first half of Viète's formula for quadratics, the full
      formula following directly from the factorization form
        $$p(x)=a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)=ax^2-2a(r_1+r_2)x+r_1r_2$$
      so
        $$-\frac{b}{a}=r_1+r_2$$
      and
        $$\frac{c}{a}=r_1r_2$$
      This is extremely useful for finding roots, especially when \(a=1\) since
      finding two whole numbers who's product is one number and sum is another
      is extremely easy in a number of important cases. For example let
        $$p(x)=x^2-6x-27=(x+3)(x-9)$$
      so the roots are \(r_1=-3\) and \(r_2=9\).
      <div class="thm">
        <h3><center>The Roots and Vertex Theorem</center></h3>
        Every quadratic can be written as
          $$p(x)=a(x-r_-)(x-r_+)=a(x-V_x)^2+V_y$$
        where the first expression is just the factorized form and the second I
        will call the vertex form, which represents parallel-shifting the
        function \(ax^2\) by \(V_x\) horizontally and \(V_y\) vertically.
        Furthermore the roots can be calculated as
          $$r_\pm=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}$$
        with the so-called "discriminant"
          $$Δ=b^2-4ac$$
        Additionally the graph has an extremum, or vertex, at
        \(V=(V_x,V_y)\) which is a minimum for positive \(a>0\), a maximum for
        negative \(a< 0\), and its coordinates can be calculated as follows
          $$V=\left(-\frac{b}{2a},-\frac{Δ}{4a}\right)$$
        The graph is also symmetric about the line \(x=V_x\).
      </div>
        It may be weird to include so many things in the theorem, but all the
        statements follow from the same argument.<br>
        This theorem provides us with a graphical interpretation of \(a\) namely
        that its sign determines whether the graph branches upwards, \(a>0\),
        or downwards, \(a< 0\), and how "steep" the "branches" are.
        <h4> Proof </h4>
          First off, we start by diving both sides by \(a\) and complete the
          square
          \begin{align}
            &&p(x)=&ax^2+bx+c\\
            \implies&&\frac{p(x)}{a}=&x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{c}{a}\\
            &&=&x^2+2\frac{b}{2a}x+\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2
            -\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+\frac{4ac}{4a^2}\\
            &&=&\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+\frac{4ac-b^2}{4a^2}\\
            \implies&&p(x)=&a\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2-\frac{Δ}{4a}
          \end{align}
          From this point, I will branch the proof into two directions, starting
          with the vertex.<br>
          <h5> Vertex </h5>
            The x-value is only present in the square, so the polynomial only
            varies with the square term. The square is always positive, so the
            sign on the square term is determined by the sign of the a-value.
            For \(a< 0\) the first term is negative, which means that for any
            non-zero value of the square, the value of the polynomial
            decreases, which makes the x-value that makes the square zero a
            maximum. Similarly, for \(a>0\) the same value is a minimum. In
            other words
              $$V_x+\frac{b}{2a}=0\implies V_x=-\frac{b}{2a}$$
            and
              $$V_y=p(V_x)=\cancel{a\left(-\frac{b}{2a}+\frac{b}{2a}\right)}
              -\frac{Δ}{4a}$$
          <h5> Roots </h5>
            A root is an x-value, \(r\) such that \(p(r)=0\), i.e.
            \begin{align}
              &&a\left(r+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2=&\frac{Δ}{4a}\\
              \implies&&r+\frac{b}{2a}=&\pm\sqrt{\frac{Δ}{4a^2}}\\
              \implies&&r=&-\frac{b}{2a}+\pm\frac{\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}
            \end{align}
            now lets see what happens if we put them into the factorized form
            \begin{align}
              a(x-r_-)(x+r_+)=&a\left(x-\frac{-b-\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}\right)^2
              \left(x-\frac{-b+\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}\right)^2\\
              =&\frac{1}{4a}(2ax+b-\sqrt{Δ}))^2
              (2ax+b-\sqrt{Δ}))^2\\
              =&\frac{1}{4a}((2ax+b)^2-\sqrt{Δ}^2)\\
              =&\frac{1}{4a}(4a^2x^2+4abx+b^2-b^2+4ac)\\
              =&ax^2+bx+c=p(x)
            \end{align}
          <p style="text-align:right;">&#x220E;</p>
        There is a slight issue with these roots. If we want real roots, which
        is what we can usually reasonably interpret, we have to require the
        discriminant to be nonnegative, i.e. \(Δ\geq0\), since we're taking the
        square root. If the determinant is \(Δ=0\) then we have only one root
        with multiplicity 2.
