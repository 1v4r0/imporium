  school system, some objects will be simplified some details will be omitted.
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Integrals </h1></center>
    The so called definite integral of a function f on an interval \([a,b]\) is
    defined as the area under the graph of f in that interval. There are several
    ways to define this and one is to divide the interval into sub-intervals
    \(a=x_0< x_1< x_2 < \cdots< x_N=b\) and then add up the areas of the
    rectangles that have the function value \(f(t_n)\) as its height and the
    width \(\Delta x_n=x_n-x_{n-1}\). If we then make the sub-intervals narrower
    and narrower, we will approach the true area under the graph. This yields
    the following definition for the definite integral
      $$\int_a^b f(x)dx=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(t_n)\Delta x_n$$</div>
    <div class="thm"><center><h2>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h2></center>
      The importance of the theorem is that it relates derivatives and integrals
      in the sense that they are somehow "inverse" operations, i.e. for functions
      with the necessary characteristics, we have
        $$f(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^xf(t)dt$$
      and
        $$\int_a^x\frac{d}{dt}f(t)dt=f(x)-f(a)$$</div>
      We will need two versions of the so-called mean value theorem for our proof.
      <div class="pro"><center><h3> The Mean Value Propositions </h3></center>
        The first states that if \(f(x)\) is differentiable in the interval \(]a,b[\)
        then there exists a \(c\in]a,b[\) such that
          $$f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$
        which in essence means that there is a value in the domain where the slope
        is the same as the average slope on the entire interval.<br>
        The second theorem states that if \(f(x)\) is continuous on \([a,b]\),
        then we can find a \(c\in[a,b]\) such that
          $$f(c)(b-a)=\int_a^bf(x)dx$$
        which means that the area under the graph is equal to the area of a
        rectangle with the interval length as its width and height corresponding
        to the function value at some point in the interval.</div>
        Being propositions, I will not prove these, but go straight to the
        proof of the fundamental theorem.
      <h3> Proof </h3>
        For the first part we want to differentiate the integral, so lets write it
        as the function
          $$F_a(x)=\int_a^xf(x)dx$$
        and start by considering the rise of the secant
        \begin{align}
          &&F_a(x+h)-F_a(x)=&\int_a^{x+h}f(x)dx-\int_a^xf(x)dx\\
          &&=&\int_x^{x+h}f(x)dx\\
          &&=&(\cancel{x}+h\cancel{-x})f(c)\\
          \implies&&\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}\to&f(x)
        \end{align}
        since \(c\in[x,x+h]\to[x,x]\) by the second mean-value proposition.<br>
        For the second statement, lets seperate the interval \([a,x]=[x_0,x_1]\cup
        [x_1,x_2]\cup\cdots\cup[x_n,x_{n+1}]\) where \(a=x_0\) and \(x=x_{n+1}\).
        Then I can create the following telescopic sum
        \begin{align}
          f(x)-f(a)=&f(x_{n+1})-f(x_n)+f(x_n)-f(x_{n-1})+\\
          &\cdots+f(x_2)-f(x_1)+f(x_1)-f(x_0)\\
          =&\sum_{n=0}^n f(x_{k+1})-f(x_k)\\
          =&\sum_{n=0}^n \frac{f(x_{k+1})-f(x_k)}{x_{k+1}-x_k}(x_{k+1}-x_k)\\
          =&\sum_{n=1}^N f'(c_k)\Delta x_k\\
          \to&\int_a^bf(x)dx
        \end{align}
        where \(\Delta x_k=x_{k+1}-x_k\). Since the left-hand-side is a constant,
        the limit must be that same constant.
