  This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
  school system, some objects will be simplified and some details will be omitted.
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Prime Numbers </h1></center>
  <center>The prime numbers are the non-units of the natural numbers that are not divisible
  by other non-units.</center>
  </div>
  In this case, the numbers 0 and 1 are the additive and multiplicative "units".
  <div class="pro"><center><h2>Prime Factorization </h2></center>
  <center>Each non-unit can be uniquely be represented by the product of primes.</center>
  </div>
  This in effect means that for any non-unit \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) can be written as
    $$n=\prod_{p\text{ prime}}p^{k_p}$$
  for example
    $$120=2^3⋅3⋅5$$
  so \(k_2=3\) and \(k_3=k_5=1\) and \(k_p=0\) for all other primes.
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Euler's Totient Function </h1></center>
  <center>Euler's totient function of a number \(\phi(n)\), counts the numbers
  \(m< n\) that are co-prime with the original number.</center>
  </div>
  The totient function of a prime is always one lower than its value, since
  the only numbers it's not co-prime with are numbers which have it in its
  prime factorization, which will be larger than the prime, i.e. \(\phi(p)
  =p-1\). For the product of two primes, then the totient function of the product
  is the product of the totient functions, i.e. \(\phi(pq)=(p-1)(q-1)\).
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Remainders </h1></center>
  <center>For two numbers \(a\) and \(n\), they can be written in terms of
  each other as
    $$n=qa+r$$
  where \(q\in\mathbb{N}\) is called the quotient and \(r< a\) is called
  the remainder. The mathematical notation for this is
    $$a\equiv r\mod n$$</center>
  </div>
  <div class="thm"><center><h2>Euler's Theorem </h2></center>
  <center>For two co-prime integers \(a\) and \(n\), then
    $$a^{\phi(n)}\equiv1\mod n$$</center>
  </div>
