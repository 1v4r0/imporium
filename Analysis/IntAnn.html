  <h1> Annuities</h1>
    In this section I will present what I will call annuities and specifically
    annuity savings and loans.<br>
    An annuity is a term-wise deposit of money into a capital, which then can
    accrue or reduce interest depending on whether it's savings or a loan. I
    will start with the most general case where we have an unknown initial
    capital and annuity \(K_0,A\in\mathbb{R}\) which can be both negative and
    positive representing loans and deposits and savings and payments
    respectively.<br>
    <h2> Lemma(Geometric Series) </h2>
      The following result on the partial sum of a geometric series, which
      technically holds only for \(x\neq1\) will be useful for the
      derivation of the annuity formula.
        $$\sum_{i=0}^nx^i=\frac{x^{n+1}-1}{x-1}$$
      <h3> Proof </h3>
        Consider
        \begin{align}
          S=&\sum_{i=0}^nx^i=1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^n\\
          \implies&&xS=&x+x^2+\cdots+x^n+x^{n+1}\\
          &&=&-1+1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^n+x^{n+1}\\
          &&=&-1+S+x^{n+1}\\
          \implies&& xS-S=&x^{n+1}-1\\
          \implies&& S=&\frac{x^{n+1}-1}{x-1}
        \end{align}
    <h2> Theorem(The Annuity Formula) </h2> The capital after \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) terms
      with a term-wise interest \(r\in[0,1]\) is
      $$C_n=\left(C_0+\frac{A}{r}\right)(1+r)^n-\frac{A}{r}$$
      <h3> Proof </h3>
        At the start of the process, we just have the initial capital \(C_0\).
        After one term we will have interest on that capital and one annuity,
        \(C_1=C_0(1+r)+A\), after the second term we will have
          $$C_2=(C_0(1+r)+A)(1+r)+A=C_0(1+r)^2+A(1+r)+A$$
        and hopefully it will not be hard to imagine that after \(n\) terms we
        will have
        \begin{align}
          C_n=&C_0(1+r)^n+A(1+r)^{n-1}+A(1+r)^{n-2}+\cdots+A(1+r)+A\\
          =&C_0(1+r)^n+A(1+(1+r)+(1+r)^2+\cdots+(1+r)^{n-1})\\
          =&C_0(1+r)^n+A\frac{(1+r)^{n-1+1}-1}{(1+r)-1}\\
          =&C_0(1+r)^n+A\frac{(1+r)^n-1}{r}\\
          =&C_0(1+r)^n+\frac{A}{r}((1+r)^n-1)\\
          =&\left(C_0+\frac{A}{r}\right)(1+r)^n-\frac{A}{r}
        \end{align}
    <h3> Corollary(Savings) </h3>
      You have annuity savings when \(A,C_0\geq0\) but lets assume that
      \(C_0=0\) then we have the following formula
        $$C_n=A\frac{(1+r)^n-1}{r}$$
    <h3> Corollary(Loan) </h3>
      You have an annuity loan when \(C_0< 0\) and \(A\geq0\). Lets assume that
      your goal is to pay back the loan, then \(C_n=0\) and you can write the
      formula as
        $$A=C_0\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-n}}$$
