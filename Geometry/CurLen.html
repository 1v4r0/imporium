  school system, some objects will be simplified and some details omitted.
  <h1> Curve Length</h1>
    To determine the curve length of the graph of a (vector)function we can
    make the following observation
      $$v(t)=s'(t)\implies s(t)\in\int s'(t)dt=\int v(t)dt$$
    so if I want to determine distances, I can integrate its derivative.<br>
    This yields the following result
    <h2> Curve Length of a Vector Function </h2>
      For a vector function
        $$\underline{r}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{pmatrix}$$
      its curve length from $t=a$ to $t=b$ is calculated as such
        $$L_{\underline{r}}(a,b)=\int_a^b\sqrt{x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2}dt$$
      <h3> Proof. </h3>
        Consider moving along the curve of this vector function, and denote by
        \(s(t)\) the distance you've moved from some point \(\underline{r}(a)\).
        Then we just need to find the speed at which we're moving, but this can
        be achieved by finding the tangent vector to the vector function. So
        \begin{align}
          v(t)=&|\underline{v}(t)|=|\underline{r}'(t)|\\
          =&\left|\begin{pmatrix}x'(t)\\y'(t)\end{pmatrix}\right|\\
          =&\sqrt{x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2}
        \end{align}
        This immediately yields
          $$L_{\underline{r}}(a,b)=\int_a^b\sqrt{x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2}dt$$
      <h3> Single Valued Functions </h3>
        If we consider a real function \(f\) that is appropriately
        differentiable, then we can find its curve length by
          $$L_f(a,b)=\int_a^b\sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}dx$$
        which is just a consequence of taking
          $$\underline{r}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}t\\f(t)\end{pmatrix}$$
        and "substituting" the variable \(t\) for \(x\).
