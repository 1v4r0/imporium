  <h1> The Schrödinger Equation </h1>
    The Schrödinger equation is a statement on realisable quantum states in the
    real world. So a solution to the Schrödinger equation is a function that
    describes the state of some quantum object.<br>
    In order to make an analogy to classical mechanics lets consider
    kinetic energy, i.e.
      $$E_{kin}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{p^2}{2m}$$
    Is quantum mechanics the momentum operator is represented by the gradient
    \(\hat{p}=-i\hbar\nabla\) which is just the partial derivative in one
    dimension, i.e. \(\hat{p}=-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\). Now we are
    ready to write the Schrödinger equation which is a statement on the
    time development as it relates to the mechanical energy of the physical
    system,
    \begin{align}
      i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t)=&E_{mec}\Psi(x,t)\\
      =&(E_{kin}+E_{pot})\Psi(x,t)\\
      =&\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+V(x,t)\right]
        \Psi(x,t)
    \end{align}
    The thing then, that dictates our quantum state is the potential and I will
    now investigate some simple potentials under the condition that the
    potential not depend on time and that the states are seperable in time and
    space.
    <h2> Seperation of Variables </h2>
      A state that is seperable can be written as
        $$\Psi(x,t)=\psi(x)\varphi(t)$$
      This has the consequence that I can investigate the time and space
      components of the Schrödinger equation seperately because
      \begin{align}
        &&i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t)=&\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
        \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+V(x,t)\right]\Psi(x,t)\\
        \implies&&i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}=&
        \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial x^2}+V\Psi\\
        \implies&&\psi i\hbar\frac{d\varphi}{dt}=&\varphi\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
        \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V\psi\right)\\
        \implies&&\frac{1}{\varphi}i\hbar\frac{d\varphi}{dt}=&\frac{1}{\psi}\left(
        -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V\psi\right)\\
        &&=&E
      \end{align}
      Since the variables are implied we disregard them as convenient and at
      the very end we have an equation where each side only depends on a different
      variable so they must both be equal to the same constant, which I will call
      \(E\) for inexplicable reasons. This has two immediate consequences,
        $$\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}=\frac{E}{i\hbar}\implies\varphi(t)∝
          e^{Et/i\hbar}=e^{-iEt/\hbar}$$
      We will absorb the proportionality constant into the full state so it will
      be omitted in the following sections. The second consequence is that
        $$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V\psi=E\psi$$
      which is called the <b> the time independent Schrödinger equation </b> and
      it's important to note that \(V\) is not simply some constant like \(E\),
      but it's a function of \(x\).
    <h2> Statistical Interpretation </h2>
      Born's statistical interpretation of the wave function of a quantum state
      states that the integral of the squared magnitude is the probability
      distribution function for the location of the quantum object. This means
      that
        $$\int_R|\Psi(\underline{x},t)|^2d\underline{x}=P(X\in R)$$
      where \(X\in R\) means that the quantum object is in that specific region.
      This then implies that
        $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}|\Psi(\underline{x},t)|^2d\underline{x}=1$$
      which is often used to "normalize" wave functions, which often involves
      determining the coefficient of the wave function, including the one from
      the seperation of variables.
    <h2> Infinite Square Well </h2>
      The infinite square well is defined as the potential \(V(x,t)=0\) for \(x
      \in[0,a]\) and \(V(x,t)=\infty\) for \(a\notin[0,a]\). This essentially
      means that the quantum object cannot exsist outside the region bounded by
      the interval. The time independent Schrödinger equation then becomes
      \begin{align}
        &&-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}=&E\psi\\
        \implies&&\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}=&-\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi=-k^2\psi\\
        \implies&&\psi(x)=&A\sin(kx)+B\cos(kx)
      \end{align}
      By imposing continuity restrictions on our states we know that \(\psi(0)=
      \psi(a)=0\) so
        $$0=A\sin(0)+B\cos(0)\implies B=0$$
      and
      \begin{align}
        &&0=&A\sin(ka)\\
        \implies&&k=&\frac{2\pi n}{a}\\
        \implies&&\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}=&\frac{4\pi^2n^2}{a^2}\\
        \implies&&E=&\frac{2}{m}\left(\frac{\pi n\hbar}{a}\right)^2
      \end{align}
      for \(n\in\mathbb{N}\). Now I'll normalize the state to determine \(A\)
      \begin{align}
        1=&\int_\mathbb{R}|\Psi(x,t)|^2dx\\
        =&\int_0^a|Ae^{-iEt/\hbar}\sin(kx)|^2dx\\
        =&|A|^2\int_0^a\sin^2(kx)dx
      \end{align}
      To integrate \(\sin^2\) we use the fact that \(\sin^2+\cos^2=1\) and that
      the area of \(\cos\) and \(\sin\) have the same magnitude on intervals
      that are whole multiples of the half-period, which is exactly the case
      here because the \(k\) was chosen to make \(x=a\) be a root of the sine
      which happens at multiples of half-periods. This yield the following
      calculation
      \begin{align}
        &&\int_0^a\sin^2=&\int_0^a\sin^2+\cos^2-\int_0^a\cos^2\\
        \implies&&\int_0^a\sin^2+\int_0^a\cos^2=&\int_0^a\\
        \implies&&2\int_0^a\sin^2=&a\\
        \implies&&\int_0^a\sin^2=&\frac{a}{2}
      \end{align}
      which in turn means that
      \begin{align}
        &&|A|=&\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}\\
        \implies&&A=&\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}e^{i\theta}\\
        \implies&&\Psi(x,t)=&\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}e^{i\left(\theta-\frac{2\hbar}{m}
        \left(\frac{\pi n}{a}\right)^2t\right)}
        \sin\left(\frac{2\pi n}{a}x\right)
      \end{align}
