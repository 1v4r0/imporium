  <h1> Integer Powers</h1>
    Assume than we have a power function with integer power, i.e. \(f(x)=x^n\),
    then its derivative is \(f'(x)=nx^{n-1}\).
    <h2> Proof </h2>
      We will perform a proof by induction, which entails confirming a base
      case and the induction step. So lets take as our base case \(n=1\), which
      yields \(f(x)=x\implies f'(x)=1=nx^{n-1}\) which comforms to our
      statement. Now assume some integer \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) also conforms to
      the statement and investigate its successor \(n=k+1\). We start by writing
      the secant slope and then rewriting it into something that depends on the
      secant slope for \(n=k\) and using our induction assumption.
      \begin{align}
        \frac{(x+h)^{k+1}-x^{k+1}}{h}=&\frac{(x+h)^k(x+h)-x^kx}{h}\\
        =&\frac{(x+h)^k(x+h)-(x+h)x^k+(x+h)x^k-x^kx}{h}\\
        =&\frac{(x+h)((x+h)^k+x^k(x+h-x)}{h}\\
        =&(x+h)\frac{(x+h)^k-x^k}{h}+x^k\cancel{\frac{h}{h}}\\
        \to&xkx^{k-1}+x^k=(k+1)x^k=(k+1)x^k
      \end{align}
    <h1> Real Powers </h1>
      Now assume the power is \(a\in\mathbb{R}\), then we can write the function
      as \(f(x)=x^a=e^{\ln(x^a)}=e^{a\ln(x)}\), which immediately yields the
      following result by the formula for the derivative of a composite function
        $$f'(x)=e^{a\ln(x)}a\ln'(x)=ax^a\frac{1}{x}=ax^{a-1}$$
