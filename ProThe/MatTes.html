    This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
    school system, some objects will be simplified some details will be omitted.
    <h1> Matching Test </h1>
      I will define a matching test as a test where you have some number of answers
      that have to be matched to the same number of questions where each answer only
      fits one question. I will denote by \(Y\) the discrete random variable that
      describes how many questions were answered correctly, but since I find it easier
      to calculate how not to answer questions correctly, I will denote by \(X\)
      the discrete random variable that describes how many points we did not get.
      That way, we have \(Y=k-X\) where \(k\) is the number of questions. Since I
      will be focusing on how not to get correct answers, I need a mechanism that
      describes that process, known as a "derangement".
    <h1> Subfactorial </h1>
      A derangement of a sequence is a permutation that has no fixed point, which
      means that no element of the sequence stays in place. The object that counts
      the number of derangements of a sequence is called the subfactorial and has
      a few common notations, of which I will use the inverted exclamation mark \(n¡\).
      We immediately obtain that
        $$1¡=0$$
      since you can't scramble a single element, and
        $$2¡=1$$
      since you can only scramble to elements by flipping them. For convenience,
      I will also define
        $$0¡=1$$
      <div class="thm"><center><h2> Iterative Formulas </h2></center>
        I will define the formulas for \(n+1\) for convenience
        \begin{align}
        (n+1)¡=&n!\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{k¡}{k!}\\
        =&k(k¡+(k-1)¡)
        \end{align}</div>
        <h3> Proof </h3>
        Denote a "correct" answer to the matching test with \(n+1\) questions, or
        any finite sequence of the same length, as
          $$ABCDE\dots$$
        where each letter represents an answer to individual questions in order.
        If I have more than 26 questions, just use any process to add unique letters.
        Now I want to calculate in how many ways I can scramble this sequence, which
        can be done by first mis-placing the \(A\). This can be done in \(n\) ways
        by placing it in any of the other places, and all these choices are totally
        symmetric, so I can just place it in \(B\)'s spot WLOG(without loss of generality).
        This yields the following configuration
          $$-A---...$$
        Now I want to place \(B\) and I can place it anywhere since it's spot is
        already occupied. There are two unique cases, either I place it in \(A\)'s
        spot or I place it in one of the others. In the former case, I have the following
        configuration
          $$BA---...$$
        where I still have to scramble the last \(n-2\) letters, but this can be
        done in \((n-2)¡\) ways by definition. In the latter case, I have \(n-2\)
        choices of where to place the \(B\) and they are all symmetric so I can just
        choose \(C\) with the following configuration
          $$-AB--...$$
        now I have to place \(C\) but the process for this is completely analogous
        to the placement of \(B\) just with one lesser options. You can follow this
        argument throughout the entire sequence and we end up with the following
        formula
        \begin{align}
          (n+1)¡=n(&(n-1)¡+(n-1)(\\
          &(n-2)¡+(n-2)(\\
          &(n-3)¡+\cdots+3(\\
          &2¡+2(1¡+1)\cdots)))
        \end{align}
        These are a bunch of layered parentheses, and if we expand them, what we
        get is
        \begin{align}
          (n+1)¡=&n(n-1)¡+n(n-1)(n-2)¡\\
          &+\cdots+\frac{n!}{2!}2¡+n!1¡+n!\\
          =&\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{n!}{k!}k¡\\
          =&n!\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{k¡}{k!}
        \end{align}
        which is the first formula. Now we can use this formula to confirm the second.
        \begin{align}
          (n+1)¡=&n!\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{k¡}{k!}\\
          =&n!\frac{(n-1)¡}{(n-1)!}+n!\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\frac{k¡}{k!}\\
          =&n(n-1)¡+n(n-1)!\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\frac{k¡}{k!}\\
          =&n(n-1)¡+nn¡\\
          =&n(n¡+(n-1)¡)
        \end{align}
        <center><p style="text-align:center;">&#x220E;</p></center>
      I will state and prove a closed form formula for later
      <div class="thm"><center><h2> Closed Form </h2></center>
        $$n¡=n!\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$$</div>
      What is slightly amazing is that these are just the partial sums for the MacLaurin
      series for \(f(x)=e^{-x}\), which means that you can actually calculate these
      by rounding the number \(\frac{n!}{e}\) to the nearest integer.
      <h3> Proof </h3>
        I will make a proof by induction and it's obviously true for \(0\leq n\leq2\),
        so assume it's true for all \(n\leq N\), and I will show it's true for \(
        n=N+1\).
        \begin{align}
          (N+1)!\sum_{k=0}^{N+1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}=&(N+1)!\left(\frac{(-1)^{N+1}}
          {(N+1)!}+\sum_{k=0}^N\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\right)\\
          =&(-1)^{N+1}+(N+1)N!\sum_{k=0}^N\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\\
          =&(-1)^{N+1}+(N+1)N¡
        \end{align}
        By the induction assumption. Now I will focus on the last term.
        \begin{align}
          (N+1)N¡=&NN¡+N¡\\
          =&NN¡+(N-1)((N-1)¡+(N-2)¡)\\
          =&NN¡+N(N-1)¡-(N-1)¡+(N-1)(N-2)¡\\
          =&N(N¡+(N-1)¡)\\
          &-(N-1)!\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}+(N-1)(N-2)!\sum_{k=0}^{N-2}
          \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\\
          =&(N+1)¡-\cancel{(N-1)!}\frac{(-1)^{N-1}}{\cancel{(N-1)!}}
        \end{align}
        since all the terms in the two sums cancel except for the highest term in
        the first one. This means that
        \begin{align}
          (N+1)!\sum_{k=0}^{N+1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}=&(-1)^{N+1}+(N+1)N¡\\
          =&\cancel{(-1)^{N+1}}+(N+1)¡-\cancel{(-1)^{N-1}}
        \end{align}
        since every other power of \(-1\) is equal.

    <h1> Main Result </h1>
      Before I state the main results, I need a lemma
      <div class="lem"><center><h2> Lemma </h2></center>
        $$g(n)=\sum_{r=0}^n\frac{1}{(n-r)!}\sum_{k=0}^r\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}=1$$</div>
        <h3> Proof </h3>
          I will show that \(g(n+1)=g(n)\) and then it follows from the fact that
          \(g(0)=1\).
          \begin{align}
            g(n+1)=&\sum_{r=0}^{n+1}\frac{1}{(n+1-r)!}\sum_{k=0}^r\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\\
            =&\sum_{r=-1}^n\frac{1}{(n-r)!}\sum_{k=0}^{r+1}\frac{
              (-1)^k}{k!}\\
            =&\sum_{r=-1}^n\frac{1}{(n-r)!}\left(\frac{(-1)^{r+1}}{(r+1)!}+\sum_{k=0}^r
              \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\right)\\
            =&g(n)+\frac{1}{(n+1)!}\sum_{r=0}^n\frac{(-1)^{r+1}(n+1)!}{(r+1)!(n+1
              -(r+1))!}\\
            =&g(n)+\sum_{r=-1}^n(-1)^{r+1}{n+1\choose r+1}\\
            =&g(n)+\cancel{\sum_{r=0}^{n+1}(-1)^r{n+1\choose r}}
          \end{align}
          since alternately adding and subtracting every element in a row in Pascal's
          triangle always yields 0.
      Now I'm ready to state the main result
      <div class="thm"><center><h2> Fixed Points of a Random Permutation </h2></center>
        Consider a finite sequence of unique elements, and choose a permutation of
        this sequence by random. Then the discrete random variable \(Y\), that describes
        the number of fixed points of this permutation, has an expected value of
        \(E(Y)=1\).</div>
      The fixed points correspond to the correct answers on the test, so this also
      represents the average number of points on the test by random guessing.
      <h2> Proof </h2>
        Lets focus on the discrete random variable \(X\) that describes the number
        of elements that are not fixed points, then \(X=n-Y\). We can calculate its
        probability function by
        \begin{align}
          P(X=r)=&\frac{|X=r|}{|\Omega|}\\
          =&\frac{{n\choose r}r¡}{n!}
        \end{align}
        since we have to select \(r\) of the \(n\) points, and then derange them.
        Now we can calculate the expected value
        \begin{align}
          E(Y)=&\sum_{r=0}^nrP(Y=r)\\
          =&\sum_{r=0}^n(n-r)P(Y=n-r)\\
          =&\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}(n-r)P(X=r)\\
          =&\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}(n-r)\frac{{n\choose r}r¡}{n!}\\
          =&\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}\frac{(n-r)\cancel{n!}}{\cancel{r!}(n-r)!\cancel{n!}}\cancel{
            r!}\sum_{k=0}^r\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\\
          =&\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{(n-r-1)!}\sum_{k=0}^r\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\\
          =&1
        \end{align}
        by the lemma.
