  This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
  school system, some objects will be simplified and some details will be omitted.
  <h1> Vector Functions </h1>
    As mentioned in <a href="Fun.html">this</a> section, vector functions are
    functions on finite dimensional Euclidean Spaces, i.e.
      $$f:\mathbb{R}^n\mapsto\mathbb{R}^m$$
    and the objects in the domain and co-domain can be considered \(n\) and
    \(m\) dimensional vectors respectively. Higher dimensions can be interesting
    for things such as AI research, but we will commonly restrict ourselves to
    \(1\leq n,m\leq3\), since this corresponds to our physical world.
    <h2> Parametric Functions </h2>
      Parametric functions are simply vector functions where \(n=1\) and
      \(m=2,3\), representing planar and spatial functions, respectively. I will
      only cover the spatial parametric functions since the planar ones are
      completely analogous.<br>
      It is common to use the following nomenclature for a spatial vector
      functions \(\underline{r}:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}^3\) with
        $$\underline{r}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\\z(t)\end{pmatrix}$$
      where \(x,y,z:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}\) are called its
      "coordinate-functions" for obvious reasons. Some people, especially
      engineers and technicians, may use an arrow above the r rather than the
      underline, but it becomes tedious to draw, conflicts with other notation
      and means the same thing, namely that the function value is a vector.
      <h3> Derivatives </h3>
        To find the derivative of a parametric function, you just differentiate
        coordinate-wise, i.e. the coordinate-functions. The first derivative
        is called the velocity vector with the following notation
          $$\underline{v}(t)=\underline{r}'(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x'(t)\\y'(t)\\z'(t)
          \end{pmatrix}$$
        In reality, we should calculate the tangent slope through the secant
        slope, but we end up with the same thing
        \begin{align}
          \frac{\underline{r}(t+h)-\underline{r}(t)}{h}=&\left(\begin{pmatrix}
          x(t+h)\\y(t+h)\\z(t+h)\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\\z(t)
          \end{pmatrix}\right)/h\\
          =&\begin{pmatrix}(x(t+h)-x(t))/h\\(y(t+h)-y(t))/h\\(z(t+h)-z(t))/h
          \end{pmatrix}\to\begin{pmatrix}x'(t)\\y'(t)\\z'(t)\end{pmatrix}
        \end{align}
        The reason it's called the velocity vector is because it's represents
        the instantaneous change in position, and visually it is tangent to
        the graph. We can do this one more time to get the acceleration vector, i.e.
          $$\underline{a}(t)=\underline{v}'(t)=\underline{r}''(t)=
          \begin{pmatrix}x''(t)\\y''(t)\\z''(t)\end{pmatrix}$$
        where this vector represents the instantaneous acceleration and is
        represents visually which way the graph is "curving".
        We can take any of these parametric functions and turn them into a
        single dimensional function by taking the length of the vectors, i.e.
          $$v(t)=|\underline{v}(t)|=\sqrt{x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2+z'(t)^2}$$
    <h2> Functions of Multiplie Variables </h2>
      Another interesting use-case is the opposite of the parametric functions,
      where \(n=2,3\) and \(m=1\). This time I will choose the lower value for
      n, since this has interesting visualizations. The nomenclature here is
      \(f:\mathbb{R}^2\mapsto\mathbb{R}\) with
        $$z=f(x,y)$$
      which has a graph that is a three dimensional surface, which can be used
      to represent a hillscape, among other things.
      <h3> Sectional Functions </h3>
        Just like with the parametric functions we can turn multivariate into
        a single variable function by relating \(x\) to \(y\). So for some
        function \(g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\), which I will call "sectioning"
        function, we can construct what I will call the "sectional" function
        \(p:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\)
          $$p(x)=f(x,g(x))$$
        which sections the surface by the graph of \(g\). On the following image
        you can see the graph of the sectioning function on the \((x,y)\)-plane
        and how it sections the surface.
        <center><img src="../Images/sec.PNG" title="Sectioning of a Surface"></center>
        If this surface represented a hillscape, then the sectional function
        would describe the our height as we followed the path of the sectioning
        function, and looking along the y-axis it would look like the following
        image
        <center><img src="../Images/sec2.PNG" title="Sectional Graph"></center>
        Two sectioning functions that are of particular interest are constant
        functions, representing cross-sections that are parallel to the axes.
        These are then \(v(x)=f(x,k)\) and \(u(x)=f(k,x)\).
        <h3> Derivatives </h3>
        In this case, it's not easy to consider one tangent, because it could
        go in any direction, so what we do is we create a so-called
        directional-derivative
          $$f_v'(\underline{r})=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(\underline{r}
          +h\underline{v}^*)-f(\underline{r})}{h}$$
        where the * denotes a unit vector in the direction of v. But it turns out that it's
        unnecessary to consider all directions at once, we can focus on the
        horizontal and vertical tangents. These correspond to so-called
        partial-derivatives.
        <div class="def"><center><h4>Partial Derivatives</h4></center>
          For the multivariate function \(f(x,y)\) and the corresponding
          cross-sectional functions \(v_k(x)=f(x,k)\) and \(u_k(x)=f(k,x)\), we
          define the partial derivative with respect to \(x\) as
            $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)=v_y'(x)$$
          with respect to \(y\)
            $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)=u_x'(y)$$
           and the corresponding "gradient" as
            $$\nabla f(x,y)=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)\\
            \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)\end{pmatrix}$$</div>
          We can relate this to the directional derivative by the following
          proposition
          <div class="thm"><center><h4>Theorem</h4></center>
            $$f_v'(x,y)=\frac{\underline{v}}{|\underline{v}|}\bullet\nabla f(x,y)$$</div>
          <h4>Proof.</h4>
            $$f_v'(x,y)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(\underline{x}+h\underline{v}^*)-f(\underline{x})}{h}$$
            $$=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+hv_1,y+hv_2)-f(x,y)}{h}$$
            $$=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+hv_1,y+hv_2)-f(x,y+hv_2)+f(x,y+hv_2)-f(x,y)}{h}$$
            $$=\lim_{h\to0}v_1\frac{f(x+hv_1,y+hv_2)-f(x,y+hv_2)}{hv_1}+v_2\frac{f(x,y+hv_2)-f(x,y)}{hv_2}$$
            $$=v_1f_x'(x,y)+v_2f_y'(x,y)=\underline{v}^*\bullet\nabla f(x,y)$$
            <p style="text-align:center;">&#x220E;</p>
   <div class="cor"><center><h4>Corollary</h4></center>
            The direction of the heighest growth is then the direction that
            makes this scalar product have the heighest value, which obviously
            is in the direction of the gradient. The magnitude of the gradient is
            the greatest slope at that point since
            $$ f_{\nabla f}'(x,y)=\frac{\nabla f}{|\nabla f|}\bullet\nabla f(x,y)=\frac{|\nabla f|^\cancel{2}}{\cancel{|\nabla f|}}(x,y)$$
             Furthermore, this also implies that the gradient being the zero vector implies
           that the slope is zero in any direction, which is a necessary and sufficient condition
     for a stationary point.</div>
     <div class="thm"><center><h4>Derivative of composites</h4></center>
      Let \(s:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2\) with \(s(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{pmatrix}\) and \(g:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}\)
      be differentiable in all variables, then the composite function \(f=g\circ s:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\)
      is also differentiable and the derivative can be calculated as follows
        $$f'(t)=\nabla g(s(t))\bullet \underline{s}'(t)$$</div>
      <h4>Proof.</h4>
      $$f'(t)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}$$
      $$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(\underline{s}(t+h))-g(\underline{s}(t))}{h}$$
      $$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(x(t+h),y(t+h))-g(x(t),y(t))}{h}$$
      $$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(x(t+h),y(t+h))-g(x(t),y(t+h))+g(x(t),y(t+h))-g(x(t),y(t))}{h}$$
      $$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(x(t)+k_x,y(t+h))-g(x(t),y(t+h))}{k_x}\frac{x(t+h)-x(t)}{h}+\frac{g(x(t),y(t)+k_y)-g(x(t),y(t))}{k_y}\frac{y(t+h)-y(t)}{h}$$
      $$=g_x'(\underline{s}(t))x'(t)+g_y'(\underline{s}(t))y'(t)=\nabla g(\underline{s}(t))\bullet \underline{s}'(t)$$
      where \(k_x=x(t+h)-x(t)\) and \(k_y=y(t+h)-y(t)\)
