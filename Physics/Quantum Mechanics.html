  <h1> The Schrödinger Equation </h1>
    The Schrödinger equation is a statement on realisable quantum states in the
    real world. So a solution to the Schrödinger equation is a function that
    describes the state of some quantum object.<br>
    In order to make an analogy to classical mechanics lets consider
    kinetic energy, i.e.
      $$E_{kin}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{p^2}{2m}$$
    Is quantum mechanics the momentum operator is represented by the gradient
    \(\hat{p}=-i\hbar\nabla\) which is just the partial derivative in one
    dimension, i.e. \(\hat{p}=-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\). Now we are
    ready to write the Schrödinger equation which is a statement on the
    time development as it relates to the mechanical energy of the physical
    system,
    \begin{align}
      i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t)=&E_{mec}\Psi(x,t)\\
      =&(E_{kin}+E_{pot})\Psi(x,t)\\
      =&\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+V(x,t)\right]
        \Psi(x,t)
    \end{align}
    The thing then, that dictates our quantum state is the potential and I will
    now investigate some simple potentials under the condition that the
    potential not depend on time and that the states are seperable in time and
    space.
    <h2> Seperation of Variables </h2>
      A state that is seperable can be written as
        $$\Psi(x,t)=\psi(x)\varphi(t)$$
      This has the consequence that I can investigate the time and space
      components of the Schrödinger equation seperately because
      \begin{align}
        &&i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t)=&\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
        \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+V(x,t)\right]\Psi(x,t)\\
        \implies&&i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}=&
        \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial x^2}+V\Psi\\
        \implies&&\psi i\hbar\frac{d\varphi}{dt}=&\varphi\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
        \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V\psi\right)\\
        \implies&&\frac{1}{\varphi}i\hbar\frac{d\varphi}{dt}=&\frac{1}{\psi}\left(
        -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V\psi\right)\\
        &&=&E
      \end{align}
      Since the variables are implied we disregard them as convenient and at
      the very end we have an equation where each side only depends on a different
      variable so they must both be equal to the same constant, which I will call
      \(E\) for inexplicable reasons. This has two immediate consequences,
        $$\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}=\frac{E}{i\hbar}\implies\varphi(t)∝
          e^{Et/i\hbar}=e^{-iEt/\hbar}$$
      We will absorb the proportionality constant into the full state so it will
      be omitted in the following sections. The second consequence is that
        $$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V\psi=E\psi$$
      which is called the <b> the time independent Schrödinger equation </b> and
      it's important to note that \(V\) is not simply some constant like \(E\),
      but it's a function of \(x\).
    <h2> Statistical Interpretation </h2>
      Born's statistical interpretation of the wave function of a quantum state
      states that the integral of the squared magnitude is the probability
      distribution function for the location of the quantum object. This means
      that
        $$\int_R|\Psi(\underline{x},t)|^2d\underline{x}=P(X\in R)$$
      where \(X\in R\) means that the quantum object is in that specific region.
      This then implies that
        $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}|\Psi(\underline{x},t)|^2d\underline{x}=1$$
      which is often used to "normalize" wave functions, which often involves
      determining the coefficient of the wave function, including the one from
      the seperation of variables.
    <h2> Infinite Square Well </h2>
      The infinite square well is defined as the potential \(V(x,t)=0\) for \(x
      \in[0,a]\) and \(V(x,t)=\infty\) for \(a\notin[0,a]\). This essentially
      means that the quantum object cannot exsist outside the region bounded by
      the interval. The time independent Schrödinger equation then becomes
      \begin{align}
        &&-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}=&E\psi\\
        \implies&&\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}=&-\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi=-k^2\psi\\
        \implies&&\psi(x)=&A\sin(kx)+B\cos(kx)
      \end{align}
      By imposing continuity restrictions on our states we know that \(\psi(0)=
      \psi(a)=0\) so
        $$0=A\sin(0)+B\cos(0)\implies B=0$$
      and
      \begin{align}
        &&0=&A\sin(ka)\\
        \implies&&k=&\frac{2\pi n}{a}\\
        \implies&&\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}=&\frac{4\pi^2n^2}{a^2}\\
        \implies&&E=&\frac{2}{m}\left(\frac{\pi n\hbar}{a}\right)^2
      \end{align}
      for \(n\in\mathbb{N}\). Now I'll normalize the state to determine \(A\)
      \begin{align}
        1=&\int_\mathbb{R}|\Psi(x,t)|^2dx\\
        =&\int_0^a|Ae^{-iEt/\hbar}\sin(kx)|^2dx\\
        =&|A|^2\int_0^a\sin^2(kx)dx
      \end{align}
      To integrate \(\sin^2\) we use the fact that \(\sin^2+\cos^2=1\) and that
      the area of \(\cos\) and \(\sin\) have the same magnitude on intervals
      that are whole multiples of the half-period, which is exactly the case
      here because the \(k\) was chosen to make \(x=a\) be a root of the sine
      which happens at multiples of half-periods. This yield the following
      calculation
      \begin{align}
        &&\int_0^a\sin^2=&\int_0^a\sin^2+\cos^2-\int_0^a\cos^2\\
        \implies&&\int_0^a\sin^2+\int_0^a\cos^2=&\int_0^a\\
        \implies&&2\int_0^a\sin^2=&a\\
        \implies&&\int_0^a\sin^2=&\frac{a}{2}
      \end{align}
      which in turn means that
      \begin{align}
        &&|A|=&\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}\\
        \implies&&A=&\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}e^{i\theta}\\
        \implies&&\Psi(x,t)=&\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}e^{i\left(\theta-\frac{2\hbar}{m}
        \left(\frac{\pi n}{a}\right)^2t\right)}
        \sin\left(\frac{2\pi n}{a}x\right)
      \end{align}
    <h2> The Harmonic Oscillator </h2>
      The harmonic oscilattor is inspired by the classical spring, i.e.
      \(F=-kx\), which then yields the potential \(V(x)=\frac{1}{2}kx^2\). We
      will write k in terms of the angular frequency of the oscillation,
      \(k=mω^2\) and this gives us the following Hamiltonian in the
      Schrödinger equation, which is the spatial/right side of the equation,
      \begin{align}
        H=&-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+\frac{1}{2}mω^2x^2\\
        =&\frac{p^2}{2m}+\frac{1}{2m}(mω x)^2\\
        =&\frac{1}{2m}[p^2+(mω x)^2]
      \end{align}
      We might get inspired by complex numbers to consider the square rule
        $$a^2+b^2=a^2-i^2b^2=(a+ib)(a-ib)$$
      but there is an issue with this, it assumes that the numbers a and b are
      commutative, i.e. that the order in which we multiply them is unimportant.
      Since it's \(p\) and \(x\) we want to consider lets test this condition.
      Lets take a test function \(f\) and apply \(xp\) and \(px\) to it
      respectively
        $$xpf=x\left(-i\hbar\frac{d}{dx}\right)f=-i\hbar x\frac{df}{dx}=-i\hbar
        xf'$$
      and
        $$pxf=-i\hbar\frac{d}{dx}(xf)=-i\hbar(f+xf')=-i\hbar f-i\hbar xf'$$
      by the product rule for derivatives. So \(x\) and \(p\) are not
      commutative, but there are some similarities, namely if we subtract the
      two expressions we get the "commutator"
        $$[x,p]=xp-px=-i\hbar x\frac{d}{dx}+i\hbar+i\hbar x\frac{d}{dx}=i\hbar$$
      This means that if we want to exchange the two terms, we need to add this
      commutator. This inspires us to define the following "conjugate" operators
        $$a_\pm=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\hbar mω}}(mω x\mp ip)$$
      called the "creation" and "annihilation" operators respectively. Lets see
      what happens when we multiply them to each other in different orders
      \begin{align}
        a_\mp a_\pm=&\frac{1}{2\hbar mω}(mωx\pm ip)(mωx\mp ip)\\
        =&\frac{1}{2\hbar mω}[(mωx)^2+p^2\mp imω(xp-px)]\\
        =&\frac{1}{\hbar ω}H\mp\frac{1}{2\hbar}i(i\hbar)\\
        =&\frac{1}{\hbar ω}H\pm\frac{1}{2}
      \end{align}
      This means that their commutator is
        $$[a_-,a_+]=a_-a_+-a_+a_-=\cancel{\frac{1}{\hbar ω}H}+\frac{1}{2}-
        \left(\cancel{\frac{1}{\hbar ω}H}-\frac{1}{2}\right)=1$$
      and we can write our Hamiltonian in terms of them in the following way
        $$H=\left(a_\pm a_\mp\pm\frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar ω$$
      Lets assume we have some quantum state in the harmonic oscillator \(\psi\)
      with energy \(E\) and apply \(a_+\) to it and see what happens in the
      Hamiltonian
      \begin{align}
        H(a_+\psi)=&\hbar ω\left(a_+a_-+\frac{1}{2}\right)(a_+\psi)\\
        =&\hbar ω\left(a_+a_-a_++\frac{1}{2}a_+\right)\psi\\
        =&\hbar ωa_+\left(a_-a_++\frac{1}{2}\right)\psi\\
        =&\hbar ωa_+\left(a_+a_-+1+\frac{1}{2}\right)\psi\\
        =&a_+\left[\hbar ω\left(a_+a_-+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\hbar ω\right]\psi\\
        =&a_+(H+\hbar ω)\psi=a_+(E+\hbar ω)\psi=(E+\hbar ω)a_+\psi
      \end{align}
      This means that if \(\psi\) is a solution to the Harmonic oscillator with
      energy \(E\) then \(a_+\psi\) is a solution with energy \(E+\hbar ω\).
      Something similar applies for the annihilation operator and we get that
        $$H(a_\pm\psi)=(E\pm\hbar ω)(a_\pm\psi)$$
      So applying these operators increases and decreases the energy of the
      system by the set amount, or "quanta", \(\hbar ω\). It should be noted
      that at no point did we attempt to actually ascertain actual quantum
      states of the harmonic oscillator, but we have come up with a statement on
      their energies. To estimate the ground state, \(\psi_0\), we assume that
      applying the annihilator operator on it will yield nothing, i.e.
      \begin{align}
        &&a_-\psi_0&=0\\
        \implies&&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\hbar mω}}\left(mωx+\hbar\frac{d}{dx}\right)
        \psi_0&=0\\
        \implies&&\frac{d\psi_0}{dx}&=-\frac{mω}{\hbar}x\psi_0\\
        \implies&&\psi_0&=Ae^{-\frac{mω}{2\hbar}x^2}
      \end{align}
      To normalize we square this and integrate
        $$1=|A|^2\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-\frac{mω}{\hbar}x^2}dx=|A|^2
        \sqrt{\frac{\pi\hbar}{mω}}$$
      which yields
        $$\psi_0=\left(\frac{mω}{\pi\hbar}\right)^{1/4}e^{-\frac{mω}{2\hbar}x^2}$$
      To determine the ground state energy consider that
      \begin{align}
        H\psi_0=&\hbar ω\left(a_+a_-+\frac{1}{2}\right)\psi_0\\
        =&\cancel{\hbar ωa_+a_-\psi_0}+\frac{\hbar ω}{2}\psi_0
      \end{align}
      since \(a_-\psi_0=0\), which means that \(E_0=\frac{\hbar ω}{2}\) and we
      can obtain all the other energy levels by raising the energy by the
      quantas \(\hbar ω\), i.e. \(E_n=\left(\frac{1}{2}+n\right)\hbar ω\), and
      the higher quantum states by repeatedly applying the creation operator,
      i.e. \(\psi_n=A_na_+\psi_0\).
