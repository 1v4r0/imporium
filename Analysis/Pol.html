  <h1> Polynomials </h1>
    A polynomial is probably the class of functions that has the most
    interesting growth pattern so far.
    <div class="def"><center><h2> Laurent Polynomials</h2></center>
    The most generalized version of a
    polynomial in the current setting is the so-called Laurent polynomial. It is
    defined as the sum of power functions with integer exponents, i.e.
      $$p(x)=\sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}a_kx^k$$
    where \(a_k\in\mathbb{C}\) are the coefficients.
  </div>
  <div style="border: 1px solid white">
  <button type="button" class="collapse">
      Example 1
  </button>
  <div class="exa">
    Consider the following Laurent polynomial
      $$p(x)=2+2x^{-1}+\sum_{k=-\infty}^{-2}\frac{x^k}{(-k)!}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}
      \frac{x^k}{(k+1)!}$$
    It has a nasty singularity at \(x=0\) since it has infinite terms that blow up
    there, but everywhere else, it will be equal to the function
      $$p(x)=\frac{e^x}{x}+e^{1/x}$$
  </div></div>
  These are relatively
    complex objects so I will restrict myself to real coefficients, with most of
    them being zero, including all the negative index ones. In fact, what's left
     is the "normal" polynomial
    <div class="def"><center><h2> Polynomials</h2></center>
    When a Laurent polynomial has \(a_k=0\) for \(i< 0\) and \(i>n\) and
    \(a_k\in\mathbb{R}\) for \(0\leq k\leq n\) we omit
    the "Laurent" and just call it a polynomial with the following expression
      $$p(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_kx^k=a_0+a_1x+\cdots+a_nx^n$$
    where some of these coefficients might still be zero, just not the last one.
    The so-called degree of this polynomial is the highest exponent, \(n\).
  </div>
    There is an important theorem, named the fundamental theorem of algebra,
    that states that the polynomial always has \(n\) roots, with
    so-called "multiplicity". With respect to the roots the polynomial can
    always be written in a factorized form as
      $$p(x)=a_n\prod_{k=0}^n(x-r_k)$$
    where
      $$p(0)=a_0=a_n\prod_{k=1}^nr_k$$
    where \(r_k\) are all the roots, and their multiplicity is how many times
    they appear in this product. If a polynomial has more than one real root
    then its graph must intersect the x-axis at least twice, which means that
    the slope of the graph must change sign at least once. This means that there
    are polynomials that are not strictly monotonous unlike power- and
    exponential functions.
    <div style="border: 1px solid white">
    <button type="button" class="collapse">
        Example 2
    </button>
    <div class="exa">
      Now consider the following polynomial
        $$p(x)=1+5x+10x^2+10x^3+5x^4+x^5$$
      It can actually be factorized into
        $$p(x)=(x+1)^5$$
      with
        $$a_5\prod_{k=1}^5 r_k=1\prod_{k=1}^5 1=1\cdot1^5=1=a_0=p(0)$$
    </div></div>
    <h2> Derivatives </h2>
      We can differentiate the polynomial term-wise and get
        $$p'(x)=\sum_{k\in Z}ka_kx^{k-1}$$
      We can also use the product rule on the factorized form
        $$p'(x)=a_n\sum_{k=1}^n\prod_{j\neq k}(x-r_j)$$
      with
        $$p'(0)=a_1=(-1)^{n-1}a_n\sum_{k=1}^n\prod_{j\neq k}r_j$$
      <div style="border: 1px solid white">
      <button type="button" class="collapse">
          Example 3
      </button>
      <div class="exa">
        Lets continue with the polynomial from the previous example
          $$p(x)=1+5x+10x^2+10x^3+5x^4+x^5$$
        Then differentiating it would yield
        \begin{align}
          p'(x)=&5+20x+30x^2+20x^3+5x^4\\
          =&5(1+4x+6x^2+4x^3+x^4)\\
          =&a_5\sum_{k=1}^5\prod_{j\neq k}(x+1)\\
          =&1\sum_{k=1}^5(x+1)^4=5(x+1)^4
        \end{align}
        which means that
          $$(x+1)^4=1+4x+6x^2+4x^3+x^4$$
      </div></div>
    <h2> Binomial Coefficients </h2>
      The two polynomials from the previous example can be generalized as
        $$p(x)=(x+1)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}x^k$$
      which has the root \(x=-1\) with multiplicity \(n\). The expression
      comes from expanding the parenthesis, since a power \(x^k\) must take an
      \(x\) from \(k\) factors and a 1 from the rest. This in effect means
      that we have to choose \(k\) out of \(n\) factors, which is done in
      \(n\choose k\) ways by <a href="../ProThe/Com.html">combinatorics</a>. If we
      subtract an \(x\) from the left hand parenthesis, we get
        $$(x+1-x)^n=1^n=1=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}x^k(1-x)^{n-p}$$
      which verifies that the <a href="../ProThe/BinDis.html">binomial
      distribution</a> is in fact a probability distribution, since this
      expression calculates the probability of all the random values for \(x=p\).
      If we consider
        $$(1-1)^n=0^n=0=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}1^k(-1)^{n-k}=\sum_{k=0}^n
        {n\choose k}(-1)^{n-k}$$
      we can observe that if we alternately add and subtract a line in Pascal's
      triangle, the result adds up to 0. This is obvious for the rows with an even
      number of numbers, by symmetry, but not equally obvious for the odd rows.
    <div class="def"><center><h2> Quadratics </h2></center>
      The one class of polynomials we will spend most of our time investigating
      are the ones of degree 2, which are known as quadratics, with the
      convention of writing \(a_2=a\), \(a_1=b\) and \(a_0=c\), i.e.
        $$p(x)=ax^2+bx+c$$
      </div>
      These three coefficients have interesting graphical interpretations but
      only the one for \(c\) is immediately obvious.
        $$f(0)=a⋅0^2+b⋅0+c=c$$
      so it's simply the initial value or the y-intercept. For \(b\) consider
      the derivative of both the normal and factorized form
        $$\boxed{p'(x)=2ax+b}=a(x-r_2+x-r_1)=\boxed{2ax-(r_1+r_2)}$$
      which means that
        $$p'(0)=2a⋅0+b=b$$
      So the interpretation of \(b\) is that it is the slope of the graph at the
      y-axis and related the sum of the roots, \(b=-a(r_1+r_2)\). The last part
      of that is the first half of Viète's formula for quadratics, the full
      formula following directly from the factorization form
        $$p(x)=a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)=ax^2-2a(r_1+r_2)x+r_1r_2$$
      so
        $$-\frac{b}{a}=r_1+r_2$$
      and
        $$\frac{c}{a}=r_1r_2$$
      This is extremely useful for finding roots, especially when \(a=1\) since
      finding two whole numbers who's product is one number and sum is another
      is extremely easy in a number of important cases.
      <div style="border: 1px solid white">
      <button type="button" class="collapse">
          Example 4
      </button>
      <div class="exa">
      An example of this is the following polynomial and it's immediate factorization
        $$p(x)=x^2-6x-27=(x+3)(x-9)$$
      by Viete's method, so the roots are \(r_1=-3\) and \(r_2=9\).
      </div></div>For example let
      <div class="thm">
        <h3><center>The Roots and Vertex Theorem</center></h3>
        Every quadratic can be written as
          $$p(x)=a(x-r_-)(x-r_+)=a(x-V_x)^2+V_y$$
        where the first expression is just the factorized form and the second I
        will call the vertex form, which represents parallel-shifting the
        function \(ax^2\) by \(V_x\) horizontally and \(V_y\) vertically.
        Furthermore the roots can be calculated as
          $$r_\pm=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}$$
        with the so-called "discriminant"
          $$Δ=b^2-4ac$$
        Additionally the graph has an extremum, or vertex, at
        \(V=(V_x,V_y)\) which is a minimum for positive \(a>0\), a maximum for
        negative \(a< 0\), and its coordinates can be calculated as follows
          $$V=\left(-\frac{b}{2a},-\frac{Δ}{4a}\right)$$
        The graph is also symmetric about the line \(x=V_x\).
      </div>
        It may be weird to include so many things in the theorem, but all the
        statements follow from the same argument.<br>
        This theorem provides us with a graphical interpretation of \(a\) namely
        that its sign determines whether the graph branches upwards, \(a>0\),
        or downwards, \(a< 0\), and how "steep" the "branches" are.
        <div style="border: 1px solid white">
        <button type="button" class="collapse">
            Example 5
        </button>
        <div class="exa">
          Lets take the polynomial from the previous example
            $$p(x)=x^2-6x-27$$
          and assume we don't know Viète's method and apply the theorem. Let's start
          by calculating the discriminant
            $$\Delta=(-6)^2-4⋅1⋅(-27)=36+108=144$$
          followed by the roots
          \begin{align}
            r_\pm=&\frac{-(-6)\pm\sqrt{\Delta}}{2⋅1}\\
            =&\frac{6\pm12}{2}=3\pm6\\
            =&-3\vee9
          \end{align}
          yielding the factorization
            $$p(x)=1⋅(x-(-3))(x-9)$$
          as previously noted. Lets now calculate the vertex
          \begin{align}
            V=&\left(-\frac{b}{2a},-\frac{\Delta}{4a}\right)\\
            =&\left(-\frac{-6}{2⋅1},-\frac{144}{4⋅1}\right)\\
            =&(3,-36)
          \end{align}
          with
            $$p(x)=1⋅(x-3)^2-36$$
          This makes sense since the the parabola is symmetric about the vertex,
          and 3 is halfway between -3 and 9, and since \(b< 0\) we know that it is
          going downward at the y-axis while intercepting it at \(y=-27\) so it makes
          sense that it might reach \(y=-36\) at the vertex.
        </div></div>
        <h4> Proof </h4>
          First off, we start by diving both sides by \(a\) and complete the
          square
          \begin{align}
            &&p(x)=&ax^2+bx+c\\
            \implies&&\frac{p(x)}{a}=&x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{c}{a}\\
            &&=&x^2+2\frac{b}{2a}x+\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2
            -\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+\frac{4ac}{4a^2}\\
            &&=&\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+\frac{4ac-b^2}{4a^2}\\
            \implies&&p(x)=&a\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2-\frac{Δ}{4a}
          \end{align}
          From this point, I will branch the proof into two directions, starting
          with the vertex.<br>
          <h5> Vertex </h5>
            The x-value is only present in the square, so the polynomial only
            varies with the square term. The square is always positive, so the
            sign on the square term is determined by the sign of the a-value.
            For \(a< 0\) the first term is negative, which means that for any
            non-zero value of the square, the value of the polynomial
            decreases, which makes the x-value that makes the square zero a
            maximum. Similarly, for \(a>0\) the same value is a minimum. In
            other words
              $$V_x+\frac{b}{2a}=0\implies V_x=-\frac{b}{2a}$$
            and
              $$V_y=p(V_x)=\cancel{a\left(-\frac{b}{2a}+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2}
              -\frac{Δ}{4a}$$
          <h5> Roots </h5>
            A root is an x-value, \(r\) such that \(p(r)=0\), i.e.
            \begin{align}
              &&a\left(r+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2=&\frac{Δ}{4a}\\
              \implies&&r+\frac{b}{2a}=&\pm\sqrt{\frac{Δ}{4a^2}}\\
              \implies&&r=&-\frac{b}{2a}+\pm\frac{\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}
            \end{align}
            now all I have to show, by Viéte, is that the sum of these is \(-\frac{b}{a}\)
            $$\frac{-b\cancel{-\sqrt{Δ}}}{2a}+\frac{-b\cancel{+\sqrt{Δ}}}{2a}=\frac{-\cancel{2}b}{\cancel{2}a}$$
            and that their product is \(-\frac{c}{a}\)
            \begin{align}
              \frac{-b-\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}\frac{-b+\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}=&\frac{(-b)^2-\sqrt{\Delta}^2}{4a^2}\\
              =&\frac{\cancel{b^2}-(\cancel{b^2+4a}c)}{\cancel{4}a^{\cancel{2}}}
            \end{align}
            where the numerator is simplified by a square rule.
          <p style="text-align:right;">&#x220E;</p>
        There is a slight issue with these roots. If we want real roots, which
        is what we can usually reasonably interpret, we have to require the
        discriminant to be nonnegative, i.e. \(Δ\geq0\), since we're taking the
        square root. If the determinant is \(Δ=0\) then we have only one root
        with multiplicity 2.
    <div class="cor">
      <h3><center>The Cubic</center></h3>
        To determine the local extrema and the point of extremal growth for the cubic, i.e.
          $$q(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$$
        we can use the following formulas
          $$m_\pm=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{\Delta_3}}{3a}$$
        where \(\Delta_3=b^2-3ac\) and
          $$M=\left(-\frac{b}{3a},-\frac{\Delta_3}{3a}\right)$$
      </div>
      <h4>Proof.</h4>
        First we need to take the derivative of the cubic which yields
          $$q'(x)=3ax^2+2bx+c$$
        Then we find the roots and vertex of this quadratic, by first observing that
          $$\Delta=(2b)^2-4\cdot3ac=4b^2-4\cdot3ac=4(b^2-3ac)=4\Delta_3$$
        \begin{align}
          m_\pm=&\frac{-2b\pm\sqrt{\Delta}}{2\cdot3a}\\
          =&\frac{-2b\pm\sqrt{4\Delta_3}}{2\cdot3a}\\
          =&\frac{-\cancel{2}b\pm\cancel{2}\sqrt{\Delta_3}}{\cancel{2}\cdot3a}
        \end{align
        To show the vertex we observe that
          $$M=\left(-\frac{\cancel{2}b}{\cancel{2}a},-\frac{\cancel{4}(b^2-3ac)}{\cancel{4}\cdot3a}}\right)$$
        <p style="text-align:right;">&#x220E;</p><br>
        Personally, I find this formula more beautiful than the one for the quadratic,
        although arguably less useful.
    <h3> Ballistics </h3>
      One application of quadratics is the ballistics of projectiles, i.e. the path
      they take through the air, ironically assuming there is no air for simplicity.
      Although the gravitational force varies slightly with height, and position
      for that matter, on the scale of most projectiles it is a reasonable approximation
      to assume that it is constant. The same goes for the associated accelleration,
      named the gravitational accelleration
        $$a(t)=g≈10\frac{m}{s^2}$$
      This number tells us that any object that is only acted on my the gravitational
      force will have its velocity increased by \(10\frac{m}{s}\) each second towards
      the ground, i.e.
        $$v(t)=gt+v_0≈10t+v_0$$
      This in turn describes the rate at which the position changes towards the
      ground. Since the velocity is not constant, we have to consider the following
      relation
      \begin{align}
        &&v(t)=&s'(t)\\
        \implies&&s(t)=&\int v(t)dt\\
        &&≈&\int 10t+v_0dt\\
        &&=&\frac{10}{2}t^2+v_0t+s_0
      \end{align}
      which tells us how to calculate the vertical position using the gravitational
      acceleration, time, and initial vertical velocity and position. Not only that
      but it turns out to be a quadratic in time, which means we can quickly calculate
      roots, which are the times where the vertical position is zero, i.e. when the
      object is on the ground. Often an object is launched off the ground so that
      \(s_0=0\), and in the opposite direction of the acceleration, so \(v_0< 0\),
      which leaves us with
        $$s(t)=5t^2-v_0t=(5t-v_0)t$$
      where \(v_0\) now represents the speed and not the velocity. This obviously
      has the roots \(t=0\vee\frac{v_0}{5}\) which in turn gives us the vertex \(V_t=\frac{v_0}{10}\),
      since the vertex is halfway between the roots. This makes sense since the
      projectile loses \(10\frac{m}{s}\) per second, so after \(V_t\) seconds, it
      has lost all it's vertical velocity and is starting to fall down. If we draw
      the graph of this quadratic it will have time on the first axis, but often
      we would be interested in the actual path the projectile takes, i.e. in a
      traditional coordinate system. To do this, I use the <a href="VecFun.html">
      parametric function</a> which represents a vector quadratic
      \begin{align}
        \underline{r}(t)=&\frac{1}{2}\underline{a}t^2-\underline{v}_0t+\underline{s}_0\\
        =&\frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}a_x\\a_y\end{pmatrix}t^2-\begin{pmatrix}
        {v_0}_x\\{v_0}_y\end{pmatrix}t+\begin{pmatrix}x_0\\y_0\end{pmatrix}\\
        =&\begin{pmatrix}
        v_xt+x_0\\5t^2-v_yt+y_0\end{pmatrix}
      \end{align}
      where the x-function is the previously mentioned quadtratic with \(a_x=0\)
      and the y-function has \(a_y=10≈g\).
