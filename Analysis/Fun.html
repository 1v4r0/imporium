  This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
  school system, some objects will be simplified and some details will be omitted.
  <h1> Definition of a Function</h1>
    A function is a mathematical object that relates pairs of other objects.
    This can be done in multiple ways but the most immediately obvious way, that
    even young children could do, is to simply place those two objects near
    each other. You can also connect those two objects by a string or by some
    description. Since we will mostly be working with mathematical abstractions,
    most of our relations will be described mathematically. As an example,
    consider the following sets of objects
      $$X=(car_1, car_2)$$
    and
      $$Y=(car_3,car_4)$$
    and
      $$Z=(red,green,blue)$$
    We could make a function that related the car to its colour, examples of
    such functions could be the following
      $$f:X\to Z\text{, and }g:X\cup Y\to Z$$
    where we call \(X=dom(f)\) and \(f(X)=ran(f)\) the
    "domain" and "range" of \(f\) respectively, and \(Z\) is the "co-domain" of both.
    Let these functions be defined as follows
      $$f(car_1)=green, f(car_2)=blue$$
    and
      $$g(car_1)=red,g(car_2)=green,g(car_3)=blue,g(car_4)=red$$
    where the first function represents the car's interior and the second
    represents the exterior paint. The first function is called
    "injective", since each car, in the domain, is assigned a
    seperate colour in the co-domain. This is not true for the second function,
    since two cars are red, but it has another property, namely that for each
    colour in the co-domain, there is a car with that colour. This property is
    called being "surjective", which the first function is not since
    neither of the cars are red. If a function is both injective and surjective
    it is really nice, since each object in the domain and co-domain is assigned
    a unique object in the other, and is called "bijective".
    <div class="def">These can be skipped on first approach <center><h2>
      Rigorous Definitions of<br>Injectivity, Surjectivity and Bijectivity </h2></center>
      For a function \(g:X\mapsto Z\) and \(Y\subset X\) we define
        $$g(Y)=\{z\in Z:z=f(y)\text{ for }y\in Y\}$$
      In relation to our example, its all the colours that are used as
      exterior colours for the last two cars.
      A function \(f:X\to Z\) is injective if
        $$f(x_i)=f(x_j)\implies x_i=x_j$$
      It's surjective if
        $$f(X)=Z$$
      and it's bijective if it's both.</div>
      This property has some consequences for the so-called inverse function.
    <div class="def"><center><h2> Inverse Functions</h2></center>
      Relating pairs of objects is theoretically a symmetric process but it
      is very useful, and common practice, to consider functions as directed
      relations, going from one object to the other. The opposite direction
      is then called the "inverse" function. The function \(f:X\mapsto Y\)
      will then have the inverse function \(f^{-1}:Y\mapsto X\) with the
      property that
        $$f^{-1}(y)=\{x\in X:f(x)=y\}$$</div>
      This can lead to the uncomfortable situation where the inverse function
      can have multiple values for each object in its domain. To be honest,
      this is not unique to the inverse function, if you consider our
      example from previously, we could imagine a car having two colours, i.e.
        $$g(car_1)=\{red,blue\}$$
      which could represent it being purple, or simply that it's not
      monochromatic. These types of functions are called "multi-valued"
      functions and you may encounter them again in the future, but for the
      current treatment I will not be analysing multi-valued
      functions in depth. Instead I will mostly consider single-valued inverse
      functions, and this can be accomplished by making sure that the original
      function is injective.
      <div class="thm"><center><h3> Inverse functions</h3></center>
        An injective function \(f:X\mapsto Y\) will have a single-valued
        inverse function, and the property that
          $$x=f^{-1}(f(x))$$
        for all \(x\in X\). If it's bijective we also have that
          $$y=f(f^{-1}(y))$$
        for all \(y\in Y\).</div>
        <h4> Proof</h4>
          Let \(y\in ran(f)\), and assume that we have two values, \(x_1\) and
          \(x_2\) that get mapped to it. Then we have
          \begin{align}
            &&f^{-1}(y)=&\{x\in X:f(x)=y\}\\
            &&\supset&\{x_1,x_2\}\\
            \implies&&f(x_1)=&f(x_2)=y\\
            \implies&&x_1=&x_2
          \end{align}
          by injectivity, which shows the inverse is single valued. Lets drop
          the subscript since they are equal, then we get
            $$f^{-1}(y)=f^{-1}(f(x))=x$$
          For the second identity, we just use surjectivety, i.e. that
          \(ran(f)=Y\), to allow us to choose any \(y\in Y\) to perform the
          following argument
            $$y=f(x)=f(f^{-1}(y))$$<p style="text-align:center;">&#x220E;</p>
        Examples of bijective functions are non-constant linear functions
        \(f(x)=ax+b\) with \(X=Y=\mathbb{R}\) and inverse
          $$x=f^{-1}(y)=\frac{y-b}{a}$$
        <a href="Exp.html">Exponential
        functions</a> \(f(x)=ba^x\) with \(X=\mathbb{R}\),
        \(Y=\mathbb{R}_+\), and
          $$x=f^{-1}(y)=\frac{\log(y)-\log(b)}{\log(a)}$$
        specifically, if \(b=1\) and \(a=e\) then we get that \(\log(y)\) is
        the inverse function to the natural exponential function. We also
        have <a href="Pow.html">power functions</a> \(f(x)=bx^a\) with
        \(X=Y=\mathbb{R}_+\) and
          $$x=f^{-1}(y)=\sqrt[a]{\frac{y}{b}}$$
        which is why we choose both \(y,b>0\) so we don't get complex
        numbers for now.

      <h2> Discrete Functions </h2>
      So far I have allowed functions to act on arbitrary(non-mathematical)
      objects, which will be useful for <a href="../ProThe/ProThe.html">
      probability theory</a> since you can consider random processes with all
      sorts of weird objects, and have the probability function relate them to
      a number, namely it's probability. On first approach, you will probably start
      an analysis of probabilities by counting the size of events, and this will
      produce so-called "discrete" functions, where the function values are seperated
      by some non-zero value, which will also produce a discrete probability function.
      These discrete functions are arguably the simplest class of functions where
      we can start doing actual mathematical analysis. One characteristic that allows
      this is that it's at this point that we can actually start systematizing the
      relation into functional expressions, e.g.
        $$f(n)=\frac{n}{12}$$

        allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
      <h2> Real Functions</h2>
      On further analysis, we introduce <a href="../ProThe/RanVar.html">random variables
      </a> where discrete probability functions will eventually be replaced by probability
      density functions, which allow both the domain and co-domain to be real intervals,
      with the latter usually being the unit interval \([0,1]\). These real functions
      are generally much more powerful than discrete functions and allow for much
      broader and powerful analysis. Most of this analysis will depend on being able
      to represent these functions with functional expressions, of various complexities.
      In fact, when you collect a discrete data-set of the relationship between two
      quantities, the first analysis you perform is often a <a href="LinReg.html">
      regression </a> which creates a real function that interpolates the data-set
      into all the intermediary points by some functional expression. With the domain
      and co-domain being such similar objects, it's often not necessary to distinguish
      between the two, so that we denote by \(x\) the value being related, regardless
      whether it is by the function or its inverse. With this convention we can write
        $$x=f(f^{-1}(x))=f^{-1}(f(x))$$

      <h3>Continuity</h3>
        One characteristic that is novel to real functions, is continuity, which
        in common terms refers to the "connectedness" of the graph. At university
        you will eventually define continuity in a much different manner, namely
        in terms of topologies, but this will suffice for now.
        <div class="def">These can be skipped on first approach <center><h4>
          Rigorous Definitions of Continuity</h4></center>
          A function \(f:X\to Y\) is called continuous if there for each \(x_0\in X\)
          and \(\delta>0\), exists an \(\varepsilon>0\) such that
            $$|x-x_0|<\varepsilon⇒|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\delta$$
          </div>
          This just means that you can make two function values arbitrarily close
          to each other by making the two variables sufficiently close to each other,
          which is exactly the same as the graph being connected.
      <h3>Differentiability</h3>
        Another novel characteristic is the slope of the graph, which requires a
        connected graph to be meaningfully defined, and a real function with this
        characteristic is called "differentiable". As opposed to linear functions,
        most functions don't have constant slope, so we will need another way to
        define the slope of an arbitrary function. To achieve this we do draw inspiration
        from linear functions, by choosing two points on the graph and drawing the
        line through these two points. This line is called the secant line and we
        can calculate its slope by the two-point theorem
          $$a=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{f(x+h)
            -f(x)}{h}$$
        where we've written the horizontal distance \(\Delta x=x_2-x_1=h\), and omitted
        the sub-script since we've expressed the second point in terms of the first.
        The slope of the secant line will approximate the slope of the function well
        for most nice functions assuming that the points are sufficiently close to
        each other, i.e. for sufficiently low \(h\). In fact if we have the two points
        "collide", we will arrive at the so-called tangent line that only intersects
        the graph in a single point locally, and this is what we define as the slope
        of the graph in that point, also known as the derivative. We use the following
        notation
          $$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
        where \(f'(x)\) denotes the slope, or derivative, of \(f\) at the point \(x\),
        the \(\lim\) is an abbreviation of the latin word "limes" and indicates the
        value of the following expression, under the condition indicated underneath,
        in this case, the distance between the points vanishing to 0.<br>
        The Danish school system teaches the so-called three step rule, that I
        personally find rather rigid and restrictive, so I will try to formulate
        a more robust rule with the same name:
        <div class="def"><center> <h4>Three Step Rule</h4><center>
          \begin{align}
          1. &\text{ Write out }\Delta y=f(x+h)-f(x)\\
          &\text{ (rewrite and reduce as necessary)}\\
          2.&\text{ Divide by }h\\
          &\text{ (rewrite and reduce as necessary)}\\
          3.&\text{ Let }h\text{ approach }0\\
          &\text{ (Use any tricks or previous results to make a conclusion.)}
          \end{align}</div>
        The main difference is that the Danish rule merges steps 1. and 2. and
        adds the reductions as the second step, but it's much more convenient not
        to divide by \(h\) until you've reduced the numerator.
      <h3> Integrability </h3>
        The last immediate characteristic is the area under the graph, which we call
        the definite integral, with the following notation
          $$\int_a^b f(x)dx$$
        which denotes the area between the graph of \(f\) and the x-axis in the interval
        \([a,b]\). The wavy symbol is an old version of the letter "S" and the "dx"
        is just a delimiter that indicates where the function ends and which letter
        is the variable of our function. There are multiple ways to define this area
        but the simplest procedure is to split the interval into sub-intervals
          $$a=x_0< x_1< x_2<\cdots< x_n< x_{n+1}=b$$
        and calculating the area of the rectangles that have these sub-intervals
        as bases and some function value, in the interval as the height. For low values
        of \(n\) this will often deviate greatly from the true area, just as with
        the slope of the secant for the derivative, but with a decreasing width of
        sub-intervals, the estimates becomes better. I.e.
          $$\int_a^bf(x)dx=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^nf(t_k)\Delta x_k$$
        where \(t_k\in[x_k,x_{k+1}]\) and as \(n\) increases, the width of all the
        intervals approach 0. This is a pretty vague and limited definition, but
        it will be sufficient for our current purposes.
      <h3> Vector Functions </h3>
        Sometimes we are interested in relating pairs, and even sets, of numbers
        to another. An example is the ideal gas law from physics
          $$PV=nRT$$
        where we can calculate the pressure if we know the other variables by
        the following function
          $$P(V,n,T)=R\frac{nT}{V}$$
        To avoid having to deal with infinities we can restrict the variables to
        be strictly positive
          $$dom(P)=\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}_+=\mathbb{R}_+^3$$
        This is pretty much the same thing as three dimensional vectors with
        positive coordinates. In general, the most common domains are the
        so-called Euclidean Spaces,
          $$X=\mathbb{R}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}^n$$
        where \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) is called the dimension. It might not be clear
        how any vectors higher than 3 or 4 might be useful, but in AI research
        you often deal with functions with domains that have dimensions in the
        dozens, hundreds or higher. In the case of the ideal gas law function,
        the domain consisted of three dimensional vectors while the range was
        just a single number, i.e.
          $$P:\mathbb{R}_+^3\to\mathbb{R}_+$$
        In general a vector function will defined as
          $$f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$$
        where \(n,m\in\mathbb{N}\).
