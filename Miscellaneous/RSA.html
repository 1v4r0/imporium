  This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
  school system, some objects will be simplified and some details will be omitted.
  <h1> Preliminaries </h1>
    in this section I will present the necessary mathematical background to perform
    RSA encryption and decryption.
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Prime Numbers </h1></center>
  <center>The prime numbers are the non-units of the natural numbers that are not divisible
  by other non-units.</center>
  </div>
  In this case, the numbers 0 and 1 are the additive and multiplicative "units".
  <div class="pro"><center><h2>Prime Factorization </h2></center>
  <center>Each non-unit can be uniquely be represented by the product of primes.</center>
  </div>
  This in effect means that for any non-unit \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) can be written as
    $$n=\prod_{p\text{ prime}}p^{k_p}$$
  for example
    $$120=2^3⋅3⋅5$$
  so \(k_2=3\) and \(k_3=k_5=1\) and \(k_p=0\) for all other primes.
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Co-prime </h1></center>
  <center>Two naturals are said to be co-prime if they share no primes in their prime
  factorizations.</center>
  </div>
  This can also be expressed in the terms of their greatest common divisor, i.e.
  the largest integer that divides both naturals, but the greatest common divisor is
  just the product of the primes they share.
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Euler's Totient Function </h1></center>
  <center>Euler's totient function of an integer \(\varphi(n)\), counts the naturals
  \(m< n\) that are co-prime with it.</center>
  </div>
  The totient function of a prime is always one lower than its value, since
  the only naturals it's not co-prime with are ones which have it in its
  prime factorization, which will be larger than the prime, i.e. \(\varphi(p)
  =p-1\). For the product of two primes, then the totient function of the product
  is the product of the totient functions, i.e. \(\varphi(pq)=(p-1)(q-1)\).
  <div class="def"><center><h1> Remainders </h1></center>
  <center>For two naturals \(a\) and \(n\), they can be written in terms of
  each other as
    $$a=qn+r$$
  where \(q\in\mathbb{N}\) is called the quotient and \(r< a\) is called
  the remainder. The mathematical notation for this is
    $$a\equiv r\mod n$$</center>
  </div>
  <div class="thm"><center><h2>Euler's Theorem </h2></center>
  <center>For two co-prime integers \(a\) and \(n\), then
    $$a^{\varphi(n)}\equiv1\mod n$$</center>
  </div>
  One last trick that will be useful in calculating remainders will be the so-called
  repeated squaring. If I have some integer \(b\), I can use it's binary representation
    $$b=\sum b_k2^k$$
  where \(b_k\in\{0,1\}\)
    to easily use it as an exponent, e.g.
    $$a^b=a^{\sum b_k2^k}=\prod_{b_k\neq0} a^{2^k}$$
  Then we can use the fact that
    $$a^{2^{k+1}}=(a^{2^k})^2$$
  to iteratively calculate the remainder of large powers of \(a\) by performing a
  series of much lower powers, and multiplying them.
  <h1> RSA </h1>
    The first step is to choose two "large" primes, \(p\) and \(q\), and take their
    product, \(m=pq\), which will be the first part of our public key and define
    our remainder classes. Then you calculate their totient function \(\varphi(m)
    =(p-1)(q-1)\). Now you choose a third prime, \(e\), that is co-prime with \(
    \varphi(n)\), which will be the second part of the public key. At this point
    we need to determine a number \(d\), which is the private key, such that
      $$1=ed-\varphi(m)k$$
    for some integer \(k\). This can be done by taking our \(m\) and dividing it
    by \(e\), then dividing the quotient by the resulting remainder, and repeating
    this process until you have a remainder of 1, i.e.
      $$\varphi(m)=q_0e+r_0\implies r_0=\varphi(m)-q_0e$$
    and
      \begin{align}
        &&e=&q_1r_0+r_1\\
        \implies&&r_1=&e-q_1r_0\\
        &&=&e-q_1(\varphi(m)-q_0e)\\
        &&=&e(1+q_0)-q_1\varphi(m)
      \end{align}
    At the very end, we end up with
      $$1=\pm(ed'-\varphi(m)k')$$
    The only issue is that the expression may have the wrong sign, if it does you
    can take your expression and add/remove \(e\varphi(m)\),
      $$1=e\varphi(m)-ed'-(e\varphi(m)-\varphi(m)k')=e(\varphi(m)-d')-\varphi(m)(e-k')$$
    until you get the correct sign with \(d=\varphi(m)-d'\) and \(k=e-k'\).
    Using this information we can
    take a message consisting of an integer \(a\) and encrypting it by calculating
      $$a^e\mod n$$
    and decrypting the result by calculating
      $$(a^e)^d\equiv a^{ed}\equiv a^{1+\varphi(n)k}\equiv a⋅\cancel{(a^{\varphi(n)})^k}\mod n$$
    <h2> Example </h2>
      Let \(p=31\), \(q=127\), \(n=31⋅127=3937\), \(\varphi(3937)=(31-1)(127-1)=30
      ⋅126=3780\), and \(e=11\). Then we have
        $$3780=343⋅11+7\implies 7=3780-343⋅11$$
      i.e. \(q_0=343\) and \(r_0=7\). Then we have
        $$11=1⋅7+4\implies4=11-1⋅7$$
      and
        $$7=1⋅4+3\implies3=7-1⋅4$$
      and finally
        \begin{align}
          4=1⋅3+1\implies&&1=&4-1⋅3\\
          &&=&4-1⋅(7-1⋅4)\\
          &&=&4⋅2-1⋅7\\
          &&=&(11-1⋅7)⋅2-1⋅7\\
          &&=&11⋅2-3⋅7\\
          &&=&11⋅2-3⋅(3780-343⋅11)\\
          &&=&11⋅(2+3⋅343)-3⋅3780\\
          &&=&11⋅1031-3⋅3780
        \end{align}
      We were lucky to get the right sign on our \(\varphi(m)\) so no further action
      is required, and we determine the private key as \(d=1031\). Before we start
      encrypting lets determine the binary representations of \(e=1101\) and \(d
      =10000000111\). Now lets try encrypting a couple of letters, "HI". I will associate
      each letter in the alphabet to it's normal placement and add 10, to avoid single
      digit numbers, so that "A" corresponds to 11, "B" to 12 etc. This means that
      "HI" corresponds to the number 1920. Before we start encrypting lets calculate
        $$1920^2\equiv1368\mod 3937$$
      which in turn means that
        $$1920^4\equiv1368^2\equiv1349\mod 3937$$
      and finally
        $$1920^8\equiv1349^2\equiv907\mod 3937$$
      Then we can do the full calculation
        $$1920^{11}\equiv1920⋅1920^2⋅1920^8\equiv1920⋅1368⋅907\equiv3346\mod 3937$$
      which means we send the message 3346. This process may seem convoluted, but
      \(1920^{11}\) is a huge number compared to the calculations I just did. The receiver
      then uses the private key to decrypt by calculating
        $$3346^{1031}\equiv1920\mod 3937$$
      which can be done in a similar manner, but a slightly longer process since
      it has a longer binary representation. In the following box, you can use the
      described system to encrypt and decrypt messages. You write your number in
      the first text-box and the second box displays an encrypted message and the
      third box displays a decrypted message.
