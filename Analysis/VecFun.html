  This section is aimed at students in upper secondary education in the Danish
  school system, some objects will be simplified and some details will be omitted.
  <h1> Vector Functions </h1>
    As mentioned in <a href="Fun.html">this</a> section, vector functions are
    functions on finite dimensional Euclidean Spaces, i.e.
      $$f:\mathbb{R}^n\mapsto\mathbb{R}^m$$
    and the objects in the domain and co-domain can be considered \(n\) and
    \(m\) dimensional vectors respectively. Higher dimensions can be interesting
    for things such as AI research, but we will commonly restrict ourselves to
    \(1\leq n,m\leq3\), since this corresponds to our physical world.
    <h2> Parametric Functions </h2>
      Parametric functions are simply vector functions where \(n=1\) and
      \(m=2,3\), representing planar and spatial functions, respectively. I will
      only cover the spatial parametric functions since the planar ones are
      completely analogous.<br>
      It is common to use the following nomenclature for a spatial vector
      functions \(\ul{r}:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}^3\) with
        $$\ul{r}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\\z(t)\end{pmatrix}$$
      where \(x,y,z:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}\) are called its
      "coordinate-functions" for obvious reasons. Some people, especially
      engineers and technicians, may use an arrow above the r rather than the
      underline, but it becomes tedious to draw, conflicts with other notation
      and means the same thing, namely that the function value is a vector.
      <div style="border: 1px solid white">
    <button type="button" class="collapse">
        Example 1
    </button>
    <div class="exa">
      Consider the following parametric function
        $$\ul{s}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}\sin(t)\\\cos(t)\\\tan(t)\end{pmatrix}$$
      so
        $$\ul{s}(\pi/6)=\begin{pmatrix}\sin(\pi/3)\\\cos(\pi/3)\\\tan(\pi/3)\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\sqrt{3}/2\\1/2\\\sqrt{3}\end{pmatrix}$$
    </div></div>
      <h3> Derivatives </h3>
        To find the derivative of a parametric function, you just differentiate
        coordinate-wise, i.e. the coordinate-functions. The first derivative
        is called the velocity vector with the following notation
          $$\ul{v}(t)=\ul{r}'(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x'(t)\\y'(t)\\z'(t)
          \end{pmatrix}$$
        In reality, we should calculate the difference quotient through a secant
        line, but we end up with the same thing
        \begin{align}
          \frac{\ul{r}(t+h)-\ul{r}(t)}{h}=&\left(\begin{pmatrix}
          x(t+h)\\y(t+h)\\z(t+h)\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\\z(t)
          \end{pmatrix}\right)/h\\
          =&\begin{pmatrix}(x(t+h)-x(t))/h\\(y(t+h)-y(t))/h\\(z(t+h)-z(t))/h
          \end{pmatrix}\to\begin{pmatrix}x'(t)\\y'(t)\\z'(t)\end{pmatrix}
        \end{align}
        The reason it's called the velocity vector is because it's represents
        the instantaneous change in position, and visually it is tangent to
        the graph. We can do this one more time to get the acceleration vector, i.e.
          $$\ul{a}(t)=\ul{v}'(t)=\ul{r}''(t)=
          \begin{pmatrix}x''(t)\\y''(t)\\z''(t)\end{pmatrix}$$
        where this vector represents the instantaneous acceleration and is
        represents visually which way the graph is "curving".
        We can take any of these parametric functions and turn them into a
        single dimensional function by taking the length of the vectors, i.e.
          $$v(t)=|\ul{v}(t)|=\sqrt{x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2+z'(t)^2}$$
        which represents the absolute speed and acceleration respectively.
          <div style="border: 1px solid white">
    <button type="button" class="collapse">
        Example 2
    </button>
    <div class="exa">
      Lets differentiate the parametric function from the previous example
        $$\ul{v}(\pi/3)=\ul{s}'(\pi/3)=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\pi/3)\\-\sin(\pi/3)\\(\cos(\pi/3))^{-2}\end{pmatrix}
        =\begin{pmatrix}1/2\\-\sqrt{3}/2\\(1/2)^{-2}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1/2\\-\sqrt{3}/2\\4\end{pmatrix}$$
        $$\ul{a}(t)=\ul{v}'(t)=\ul{s}''(t)=\begin{pmatrix}-\sin(\pi/3)\\-\cos(\pi/3)\\\frac{2\sin(\pi/3)}{\cos^3(\pi/3)}\end{pmatrix}
        =\begin{pmatrix}-\sqrt{3}/2\\-1/2\\\frac{2\sqrt{3}/2}{(1/2)^3}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-\sqrt{3}/2\\-1/2\\8\sqrt{3}\end{pmatrix}$$
        with
        $$|v(\pi/3)|=\sqrt{\cos^2(\pi/3)+(-\sin(\pi/3))^2+((\cos(\pi/3))^{-2})^2}=\sqrt{1+4^2}=\sqrt{17}$$
        and
        $$|a(\pi/3)|=\sqrt{1+8^2\cdot3}=\sqrt{193}$$
      </div></div>
      <h3>Curve length</h3>
      To calculate the curve length, we can integrate the "speed" in the interval, i.e.
      <div class="def"><center><h4>Curve Length</h4></center>
        Assume that the function \(s(t)\) represents a one dimensional position on the curve,
        e.g. by assuming that \(s(0)=0\). Then the curve length \(L\) from \(t=t_0\)
        to \(t=t_1\) is the distance covered in the same interval, i.e.
            $$L=s(t_1)-s(t_0)=\int_{t_0}^{t_1}s'(t)dt=\int_{t_0}^{t_1}|\ul{s}'(t)|dt=\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\sqrt{x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2+z'(t)^2}dt$$</div>
            <div style="border: 1px solid white">
      <button type="button" class="collapse">
        Example 3
    </button>
    <div class="exa">
      Lets find the curve length from \(t_0=\pi/6\) to \(t_1=\pi/3\)
        $$L=\int_{\pi/6}^{\pi/3}\sqrt{1+(\cos(t))^{-4}}dt\approx1.28$$
      </div></div>
    <h2> Functions of Multiplie Variables </h2>
      Another interesting use-case is the opposite of the parametric functions,
      where \(n=2,3\) and \(m=1\). This time I will choose the lower value for
      n, since this has interesting visualizations. The nomenclature here is
      \(f:\mathbb{R}^2\mapsto\mathbb{R}\) with
        $$z=f(x,y)$$
      which has a graph that is a three dimensional surface, which can be used
      to represent a hillscape, among other things.
      <div style="border: 1px solid white">
      <button type="button" class="collapse">
        Example 4
    </button>
    <div class="exa">
      As an example of a function of two variables is the following function
      inspired by quantum mechanics
        $$f(x,y)=2\sin(\pi x)\cos(y)$$
      its graph is similar to the image below.
      </div></div>
      <h3> Sectional Functions </h3>
        Just like with the parametric functions we can turn multivariate into
        a single variable function by relating \(x\) to \(y\). So for some
        function \(g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\), which I will call "sectioning"
        function, we can construct what I will call the "sectional" function
        \(p:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\)
          $$p(x)=f(x,g(x))$$
        which sections the surface by the graph of \(g\). On the following image
        you can see the graph of the sectioning function on the \((x,y)\)-plane
        and how it sections the surface.
        <center><img src="../Images/sec.PNG" title="Sectioning of a Surface"></center>
        If this surface represented a hillscape, then the sectional function
        would describe the our height as we followed the path of the sectioning
        function, and looking along the y-axis it would look like the following
        image
        <center><img src="../Images/sec2.PNG" title="Sectional Graph"></center>
        Two sectioning functions that are of particular interest are constant
        functions, representing cross-sections that are parallel to the axes.
        These are then \(v(x)=f(x,k)\) and \(u(x)=f(k,x)\).
        <h3> Derivatives </h3>
        In this case, it's not easy to consider one tangent, because it could
        go in any direction, so what we do is we create a so-called
        directional-derivative
          $$f_v'(\ul{r})=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(\ul{r}
          +h\ul{v}^*)-f(\ul{r})}{h}$$
        where the * denotes a unit vector in the direction of v.
           <div style="border: 1px solid white">
      <button type="button" class="collapse">
        Example 5
    </button>
    <div class="exa">
      Lets find the derivative in the direction of \(\ul{v}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\pi/3)\\\sin(\pi/3)\end{pmatrix}\)
        $$f_v'(x,y)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{2\sin(\pi(x+h\cos(\pi/3)))\cos(y+h\sin(\pi/3))-2\sin(\pi x)\cos(y)}{h}$$
        $$=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{2\sin(\pi x+h\pi/2)\cos(y+h\sqrt{3}/2)-2\sin(\pi x)\cos(y)}{h}$$
        $$=2\pi\cos(\pi x)\cos(y)\cos(\pi/3)-2\sin(\pi x)\sin(y)\sin(\pi/3)$$
        $$=\pi\cos(\pi x)\cos(y)-\sqrt{3}\sin(\pi x)\sin(y)$$
      I will explain below how I did the last two calculations, but this function tells us the slope
      of the graph in the direction of \(\ul{v}\). If we choose to section the graph by \(y=\pi x\) we get
        $$f_v'(x,\pi x)=\pi\cos^2(\pi x)-\sqrt{3}\sin^2(\pi x)$$
      One consequence of this is that along the line \(y=\pi x\) the slope in the
      direction of \(\ul{v}\) alternates between \(\pi\) and \(-\sqrt{3}\).
      </div></div>
      But it turns out that it's
        unnecessary to consider all directions at once, we can focus on the
        horizontal and vertical tangents. These correspond to so-called
        partial-derivatives.
        <div class="def"><center><h4>Partial Derivatives</h4></center>
          For the multivariate function \(f(x,y)\) and the corresponding
          cross-sectional functions \(v_k(x)=f(x,k)\) and \(u_k(x)=f(k,x)\), we
          define the partial derivative with respect to \(x\) as
            $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)=v_y'(x)$$
          with respect to \(y\)
            $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)=u_x'(y)$$
           and the corresponding "gradient" as
            $$\nabla f(x,y)=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)\\
            \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)\end{pmatrix}$$</div>
            <div style="border: 1px solid white">
      <button type="button" class="collapse">
        Example 6
    </button>
    <div class="exa">
      Lets find the partial derivatives and gradient from the previous example
        $$f_x'(x,y)=2\pi\cos(\pi x)\cos(y)$$
        $$f_y'(x,y)=-2\sin(\pi x)\sin(y)$$
        $$\nabla f(1/3,\pi/6)=\begin{pmatrix}2\pi\cos(\pi/3)\cos(\pi/6)\\-2\sin(\pi/3)\sin(\pi/6)\end{pmatrix}$$
        $$=\begin{pmatrix}2\pi\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sqrt(3)}{2}\\-2\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\frac{1}{2}\end{pmatrix}$$
        $$=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\begin{pmatrix}\pi\\-1\end{pmatrix}$$
      </div></div>
          We can relate this to the directional derivative by the following
          proposition
          <div class="thm"><center><h4>Theorem</h4></center>
            $$f_v'(x,y)=\frac{\ul{v}}{|\ul{v}|}\bullet\nabla f(x,y)$$</div>
          <h4>Proof.</h4>
            $$f_v'(x,y)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(\ul{x}+h\ul{v}^*)-f(\ul{x})}{h}$$
            $$=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+hv_1,y+hv_2)-f(x,y)}{h}$$
            $$=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+hv_1,y+hv_2)-f(x,y+hv_2)+f(x,y+hv_2)-f(x,y)}{h}$$
            $$=\lim_{h\to0}v_1\frac{f(x+hv_1,y+hv_2)-f(x,y+hv_2)}{hv_1}+v_2\frac{f(x,y+hv_2)-f(x,y)}{hv_2}$$
            $$=v_1f_x'(x,y)+v_2f_y'(x,y)=\ul{v}^*\bullet\nabla f(x,y)$$
            <p style="text-align:center;">&#x220E;</p>
   <div class="cor"><center><h4>Corollary</h4></center>
            The direction of the heighest growth is then the direction that
            makes this scalar product have the heighest value, which obviously
            is in the direction of the gradient. The magnitude of the gradient is
            the greatest slope at that point since
            $$ f_{\nabla f}'(x,y)=\frac{\nabla f}{|\nabla f|}\bullet\nabla f(x,y)=\frac{|\nabla f|^\cancel{2}}{\cancel{|\nabla f|}}(x,y)$$
             Furthermore, this also implies that the gradient being the zero vector implies
           that the slope is zero in any direction, which is a necessary and sufficient condition
     for a stationary point.</div>
     This allows us to state the well known theorem on stationary points which are
     points where "action" halts, i.e. the slope is zero, which is to say that all
     the directional derivatives are all zero, but all we need here is that the
     gradient is zero by the previous theorem.
    <div class="def"><center><h4>Stationary Points</h4></center>
      A stationary point is a point on a surface where all derivatives are zero.
      On a surface of a multivariable function, this specifically means that the
      gradient is zero at that point, i.e.
        $$\nabla f(\ul{x})=\ul{0}$$
      </div>
      It should be noted that these points are technically the full dimensional object,
      but if it lies on the graph of a function, it can be referred to by the domain
      since last coordinate will be inferred from the function. For example, the
      stationary point of \(f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\) is \((0,0,0)\) but you could also state
      it as being \((0,0)\) where you can infer the full point as \((0,0,f(0,0))\).<br>
      These stationary points can have two clearly defined "types", depending on
      how they are formed. If we have a stationary point which curves "differently"
      in two different directions, we have a so-called saddle-point. If the curvatures
      are similar in all directions, we will have an extremum, assuming that the torsion
      isn't too great. This involves the second partial derivatives and can be stated as follows.
      <div class="pro"><center><h4>Types of Stationary Points</h4></center>
        We compare the curvature and torsion at the point, which can be expressed as
        the determinant of the "Hesse matrix".
        $$\begin{vmatrix}f_{xx}''&&f_{xy}''\\f_{yx}''&&f_{yy}''\end{vmatrix}=f_{xx}''f_{yy}''-f_{xy}''f_{yx}''$$
        <center>1. If this number is positive, there is more curvature than there is torsion, and we have an extremum.</center>
        <center>2. If this number is negative, the torsion is stronger than the curvature, and we have a saddle-point.</center>
        <center>3. If they are equal, it is generally a more complicated shape, which would require further analysis.</center></div>
     <div class="thm"><center><h3>Derivative of composites</h3></center>
      Let \(s:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2\) with \(s(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{pmatrix}\) and \(g:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}\)
      be differentiable in all variables, then the composite function \(f=g\circ s:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\)
      is also differentiable and the derivative can be calculated as follows
        $$f'(t)=\nabla g(s(t))\bullet \ul{s}'(t)$$</div>
      <h4>Proof.</h4>
      $$f'(t)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}$$
      $$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(\ul{s}(t+h))-g(\ul{s}(t))}{h}$$
      $$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(x(t+h),y(t+h))-g(x(t),y(t))}{h}$$
      $$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(x(t+h),y(t+h))-g(x(t),y(t+h))+g(x(t),y(t+h))-g(x(t),y(t))}{h}$$
      $$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(x(t)+k_x,y(t+h))-g(x(t),y(t+h))}{k_x}\frac{x(t+h)-x(t)}{h}+\frac{g(x(t),y(t)+k_y)-g(x(t),y(t))}{k_y}\frac{y(t+h)-y(t)}{h}$$
      $$=g_x'(\ul{s}(t))x'(t)+g_y'(\ul{s}(t))y'(t)=\nabla g(\ul{s}(t))\bullet \ul{s}'(t)$$
      where \(k_x=x(t+h)-x(t)\) and \(k_y=y(t+h)-y(t)\)
